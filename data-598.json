This ensures that all parties have confidence in the decisions made by the court, and that the law is applied consistently. Judges also have the power to issue warrants and to make orders that are necessary for the administration of justice.The work of a judge can be both challenging and rewarding.

It is defined as the act of taking part in or encouraging an illegal activity, or participating in a plan to do so. The punishment for interest can range from a fine to imprisonment, depending on the severity of the offense. In the United States, the punishment for interest is typically a misdemeanor conviction, which is punishable by a fine or up to a year in jail. The punishment for felony interest is more severe, and can result in a prison sentence of more than a year. In some cases, the punishment for interest may be mitigated if the individual can show that they did not have any criminal intent. For example, if someone is found to have been participating in a protest against an illegal activity, they may be able to avoid punishment if they can prove that their purpose was not to break the law. Interest can also be charged in civil cases, where the penalty is typically a monetary damages award. In some cases, however, a court may order an individual to perform community service or take other corrective action in lieu of paying a fine. The bottom line is that interest is a serious matter that can result in punishment under both criminal and civil law. If you are found to have been involved in an illegal activity, you could face a fine, jail time, or other penalties. Therefore, it is important to make sure that you understand the risks before you engage in any sort of illegal activity.", "In mathematics, a number is a value that represents a quantity, such as 2 or 3.95.

Cities generally have extensive systems for housing, transportation, sanitation, utilities, land use, and communication. Their density facilitates interaction between people, government organizations and businesses, sometimes benefiting different parties in the process.Cities are traditionally built upon areas with dense resources, making them ideal locations for trade. Consequently, cities tend to generate economic growth and spur innovation. They also offer opportunities for social interaction and the exchange of ideas. For all of these reasons, cities have been seen as engines of civilization.The first cities arose in the ancient world, with some evidence of urbanization as early as 3000 BCE. The largest city in the world by population is Tokyo, while the largest in terms of landmass is Moscow. Cities have been categorized according to their size (measured by population), location (i.e. rural or urban), and their role in the national or international economy. The most common type of city is the metropolis, which is a large urban area that is home to a significant proportion of a country\u2019s population.", "Purchasing is the process of acquiring goods or services for monetary compensation. The term can be referring to either the act of buying something, or the department within a company charged with procuring supplies. Companies will often have strict purchasing policies in place in order to ensure that money is being spent wisely and in a way that aligns with the company's goals. The purchasing process typically begins with the identification of a need. Once the need is determined, the purchasing department will research potential vendors and compare prices. Once a vendor is selected, the department will work with them to negotiate terms and create a contract. The contract will outline the terms of the purchase, including the price, delivery date, and any warranties or guarantees. The purchasing department is responsible for ensuring that the goods or services ordered are received in a timely manner and that they meet the quality standards specified in the contract. If there are any problems with the order, it is the responsibility of the purchasing department to work with the vendor to resolve the issue.

In other words, efficiency is a measure of how well something is able to utilize available resources to achieve desired results. Efficiency is often used in reference to machines, engines, or any system where work is done. It can also be used in reference to the efficiency of chemical reactions, or of any process where energy is converted from one form to another.Generally, efficiency is improved when less energy is required to achieve the same amount of work, or when more work is done with the same amount of energy. There are many ways to increase the efficiency of a system, such as by using more efficient components, by decreasing frictional losses, or by increasing the system's overall power.Efficiency is usually expressed as a percentage, and is often used in reference to the efficiency of engines or machines. For example, a car engine with an efficiency of 20% means that for every 100 units of energy that are inputted into the engine, only 20 units of energy are converted into work. The remaining 80 units of energy are lost as heat or Frictional losses.There are many factors that can affect the efficiency of a system, such as the quality of the components, the design of the system, and the operating conditions. Efficiency can also be affected by environmental factors, such as temperature and humidity.Efficiency is an important consideration in many fields, such as engineering, manufacturing, and science. Improving the efficiency of systems can lead to significant improvements in productivity and cost-savings.", "A cost is something that is paid or given up in order to get something. It is often measured in money.There are many different types of costs. For example, there are opportunity costs, which are the benefits that could have been obtained by using a resource in a different way. There are also sunk costs, which are costs that have already been incurred and cannot be recovered.Opportunity cost is often thought of as the most important type of cost. This is because it represents the true cost of something, in terms of the opportunity that was missed by pursuing it.Sunk costs are important to consider as well, because they can influence decision-making. For example, if a company has already invested a lot of money in a project, they may be more likely to continue with it even if it is no longer feasible, in order to avoid the loss of their investment.Costs can also be classified as fixed or variable. Fixed costs are costs that do not change with the level of production, such as rent. Variable costs are costs that do change with the level of production, such as the cost of raw materials.Knowing the different types of costs is important in business, because it helps managers make better decisions about where to allocate resources.

It is one of the primary functions of an organization and is considered to be a part of the supply chain management. The objective of purchasing is to obtain items that are necessary for the organization to operate at a lower cost while maintaining the required quality and quantity. The process of purchasing begins with the identification of the need for a particular good or service. This need can be generated internally by the organization or externally by the customers. Once the need is identified, the purchasing department initiates the process of procuring the required item. The first step in procurement is to identify the potential sources that can provide the required item. The purchasing department then contacts the chosen supplier and negotiating the best possible price for the good or service. Once the price is finalized, a purchase order is issued to the supplier. The supplier ships the goods or provides the service to the organization and sends an invoice to the purchasing department. The department then checks the invoice to ensure that it matches the purchase order and terms of the contract. After the invoice is approved, the department will make the payment to the supplier. Purchasing is a critical function in any organization as it helps to ensure that the necessary items are obtained at a lower cost. It is important to carefully select the supplier and negotiate the best possible price to minimize the expenditure of the organization.", "A department is a division of an organization.

They are the cornerstone of any civilization, and provide the framework within which people can live and work together peacefully. Without laws, there would be anarchy and chaos.Laws are created by lawmakers, who are elected by the people to represent their interests. The lawmakers formulate the laws based on the input of their constituents, and then vote on them. If a majority of the lawmakers approve of a particular law, it is sent to the president for his signature. Once the president signs a law, it becomes binding on all citizens of the country.There are different types of laws, which address different aspects of society. For example, there are criminal laws, which are designed to punish people who break the law. There are also civil laws, which govern matters such as contract disputes and property rights.Laws are enforced by the police, who are responsible for investigating crimes and arresting suspects. The courts are responsible for interpreting the laws and deciding whether or not someone has broken them. If someone is found guilty of breaking a law, they may be fined, imprisoned, or both.Laws are constantly evolving, as lawmakers strive to find better ways to protect the rights of citizens and keep society safe. New laws are constantly being proposed and debated, and old laws are regularly being challenged and overturned. The process of creating and changing laws is an essential part of democracy, and ensures that the laws always reflect the will of the people.", "A legislature is a type of representative deliberative assembly with the power to pass, amend, and repeal laws. The lawmaking body of a nation, state, or subnational entity is usually known as a parliament, congress, or diet. Legislatures observe and steer governing actions and usually have exclusive authority over financial legislation and the power of the purse. The name is derived from the Latin legis, meaning \"law\".Most legislatures are bicameral, meaning they have two chambers or houses. The house of representatives is usually the lower house, while the senate is the upper house. In some countries, the different houses have different names. In most bicameral legislatures, the chamber of representatives is the larger body, and often has more power than the senate. This is due to their being more numerous and having a more direct connection to the people. The senate is often seen as a more deliberative body, and as a result, legislation often originates in the house of representatives and is then passed to the senate for debate and amendment.The members of a legislature are usually elected by the people of the jurisdiction they represent. However, in some cases, members may be appointed by the executive branch or the judiciary. In many democracies, the legislature is subject to the veto power of the executive, meaning the executive Branch can choose to veto any legislation that the legislature has passed. This system of checks and balances is intended to prevent any one branch of government from having too much power.The size of a legislature depends on the size of the jurisdiction it represents. For example, the United States Congress is made up of 435 members of the house of representatives and 100 senators, for a total of 535 members. The European Parliament, on the other hand, has 751 members.The work of a legislature is often divided into four main stages: legislation, representation, control, and oversight.During the legislation stage, bills are drafted, debated, and voted on. Bills that are passed by the legislature are then sent to the executive for signing into law. The representative stage involves the legislature acting on behalf of the people it represents. This includes passing laws, but also undertaking activities such as authorizing the spending of funds and ratifying treaties. The control stage refers to the legislature's power to check and balance the other branches of government. This is done through its power of the purse, as well as its ability to impeach executive and judicial officials. Finally, the oversight stage refers to the legislature's role in holding the other branches of government accountable and ensuring that they are acting in the best interests of the people.In conclusion, the legislature is a type of representative body that is responsible for passing laws and overseeing the other branches of government.", "A date is a social or romantic appointment or engagement.

It can be done gradually, all at once, or in stages. The method chosen will often depend on the type of change that is being made. For example, if a company is introducing a new computer system, it would be impractical to do so all at once. Instead, it would be rolled out gradually to different departments.The success of an implementation often depends on how well it is planned. If all the relevant parties are not consulted and involved in the process, it is likely to be less successful. It is also important to consider the resources that are required and to have a backup plan in case of problems.Once a plan has been put into effect, it is important to monitor the results and make sure that it is having the desired effect. If not, then adjustments can be made. The implementation process is therefore an ongoing one that should be reviewed and updated as necessary.", "When you hear the word swipe, you might think of taking something away quickly or carelessly.

In many cultures, a child is also considered to be someone who is not yet an adult and is still dependent on their parents.There are many different words that can be used to describe a child, including baby, toddler, kid, and teenager. A child is often seen as a blessing, and parents may feel blessed to have a child. In some cases, a child may be seen as a burden, and parents may feel burdened by their child.Children typically have a lot of energy, and they often like to play. They may also be very curious and ask a lot of questions. Children are often very innocent and na\u00efve. They typically have a imagination, and they may believe in things that adults know are not real.Children often learn by watching and imitating adults. They may also learn through experience, trial and error. Children typically go through different stages of development as they grow up. These stages of development are often divided into categories, such as physical, cognitive, social, and emotional.Physical development refers to the changes that occur in a child\u2019s body. These changes include things like an increase in height and weight, the development of muscles and bones, and the development of sexual characteristics.Cognitive development refers to the changes that occur in a child\u2019s ability to think and understand. These changes include things like an increase in memory and the ability to think abstractly.Social development refers to the changes that occur in a child\u2019s ability to interact with others. These changes include things like an increase in communication and social skills.Emotional development refers to the changes that occur in a child\u2019s ability to regulate their emotions.

Welfare programs are typically funded by tax revenue and administered by the government.The first welfare program in the United States was the Social Security Act of 1935, which provided financial assistance to elderly and disabled Americans. Since then, a number of other welfare programs have been created, including Medicaid, food stamps, and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF).Welfare programs are means-tested, which means that individuals and families must meet certain income and asset requirements in order to qualify for assistance. In general, welfare programs provide financial assistance to help low-income individuals and families cover basic needs such as food, housing, and clothing.Critics of welfare argue that the programs are inefficient and full of waste, fraud, and abuse. They also argue that welfare undermines work incentives and encourages dependency on the government. Supporters of welfare argue that the programs are necessary to help the most vulnerable members of society and that they provide a safety net for those who are unable to work.The debate over welfare is ongoing, and it is unlikely that there will be a definitive resolution in the near future.", "Assistance refers to the help or support given to someone or something.

Programs can be written in a variety of different languages, each of which has its own set of rules and syntax. Programs are typically designed to perform a specific task, such as calculating interest on a loan or displaying a menu of choices to a user.Most programs are written in a high-level programming language that can be read and understood by humans. These languages are easier to learn and use than the machine code that is actually executed by the computer. Programs written in a high-level language are translated into machine code by a compiler or interpreter before they can be run.Once a program is written, it must be tested to ensure that it works as intended. This process can be time-consuming and expensive, particularly for large and complex programs. Once a program is debugged and working correctly, it can be distributed to users.Programs can be divided into two main categories: system software and application software. System software includes the operating system and other utilities that enable the computer to function. Application software consists of programs that perform specific tasks for users.System software is typically pre-installed on a computer when it is purchased. Application software must be installed separately. Some programs are available for free, while others must be purchased. Many programs can be downloaded from the Internet.Once a program is installed, it can be run by double-clicking on its icon or by entering a specific command. Some programs require additional data or files in order to run correctly. These files are typically stored in the same folder as the program.When a program is running, it is said to be \u201cin memory.\u201d Programs can be ended or \u201ckilled\u201d manually, or they may end automatically when they are finished executing their instructions. Some programs are designed to run continuously, such as server software. Programs are an essential part of modern computing, and they are likely to become even more important in the future.", "The word 'fit' can be used as a noun, verb, or adjective.

It is the root of all sorts of social and economic problems, but it is also the reason our society function. To put it simply, money is an idea that we have all agreed to believe in. It is used as a way to exchange goods and services and to measure worth.In the past, people used items that had value themselves to trade for other things. This created a problem because not everything someone had to trade was equally valuable. To fix this, people came up with the idea of money. Money is an object that represents a certain value. It can be used to buy or trade for other objects, without having to worry about whether or not the item being traded is of equal value.Of course, money is only as valuable as the people agree it is. Money is not backed by any physical commodity, like gold or silver. Its value comes from the fact that people believe in it and are willing to use it. This can be seen as a good or a bad thing. On the one hand, it means that money can be created out of thin air and used to buy things even if there is no physical item to back it up. On the other hand, it also means that the value of money can fluctuate wildly and people can lose their savings if the economy takes a turn for the worse.There are different types of money, including paper money and coins, which are called fiat money. Fiat money is not backed by any physical commodity, but instead by the government that issued it. The value of fiat money comes from the fact that the government requires its citizens to use it to pay taxes. This artificial demand gives fiat money its value.But not all money is fiat money. There is also cryptocurrency, which is a digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography to secure its transactions. Cryptocurrency is not regulated by any government and its value comes from the fact that people are willing to trade it for goods and services. Cryptocurrency is a decentralized currency, which means that it is not subject to the whims of any central authority.So, in short, money is an idea that we have all agreed to believe in. It is used as a way to exchange goods and services and to measure worth. It is created when people are willing to trade it for goods and services. The value of money can fluctuate, depending on the demand for it. And finally, money is either fiat or cryptocurrency.", "A distribution is a function that describes how a population is distributed.

Parties to a legal dispute may file a lawsuit in a court, which will hear and decide the case.Items commonly heard in a court include motions, pleas, verdicts, and sentences. Courts typically have hierarchy, with different courts having jurisdiction over different cases. For example, in the United States, there is a federal court system and each state has its own court system.There are many different types of courts, including criminal courts, which hear cases involving crimes; civil courts, which hear cases involving disputes between two or more parties; and administrative courts, which hear cases involving the government.The procedures for how a court case proceeds vary depending on the type of court and the jurisdiction, but generally follow a similar pattern. First, one or more of the parties to the dispute files a complaint or petition with the court. This is followed by a response from the other party or parties. Next, there is usually a discovery period, during which both parties can request information from the other party and conduct depositions.After discovery, the parties may file motions, which are requests to the court for a specific ruling on an issue. For example, a party may file a motion for summary judgment, asking the court to rule in their favor without having a trial, if they believe the other party does not have any evidence to support their case.If the case goes to trial, both sides will present their evidence and arguments to the judge or jury. The judge or jury will then make a decision, which is called a verdict. If the verdict is in favor of one party, the other party may appeal the decision.Courts also have the power to issue orders, which are directives from the court to a party or parties in a case. For example, the court may order a company to produce documents that are relevant to the case.There are many different types of orders that a court can issue, and the specific order will depend on the facts of the case.

It is one of the elements that make up our world and it has been both a friend and a foe to us throughout our history.Fire, at its most basic, is the result of a chemical reaction between two substances. When these substances are heated to a certain temperature, they will undergo a chemical reaction that produces fire.The most common type of fire is combustion, which is when a fuel and an oxidizer are combined and then ignited. The fuel is something that will burn, such as wood or gasoline, while the oxidizer is something that provides the oxygen for the fire to burning, such as the air.When a fire starts, it will continue to burn until one of the elements is removed. The fire will need fuel, oxygen, and heat in order to continue burning. If any of these elements are removed, the fire will go out.Fire has been used by humans since the very beginning. It was first used for warmth and light, and it quickly became an important part of our survival. Fire allowed us to cook food, to keep warm, to ward off predators, and to signal for help.Over time, we have learned to control fire and to use it for our benefit.

Early theories of management were developed in the context of industrial organizations, with the aim of increasing productivity and efficiency.One of the earliest management theorists was Frederick Winslow Taylor, who is credited with developing the scientific management approach. This approach advocates for the careful analysis of work tasks in order todevelop efficient methods of performing them.Other important early management theorists include Henri Fayol and Max Weber. Fayol's work was influential in the development of management principles, which are still used in management education today. Weber's work was significant in the development of bureaucracy as a way of organizing organizations.The early 20th century saw the rise of mass production, which led to the development of new management approaches such as the assembly line and scientific management. These approaches were designed to further increase productivity and efficiency in organizations.In the latter half of the 20th century, management theories began to focus more on the human aspects of organizations, such as motivation, communication, and leadership. This shift was due in part to the increasing importance of knowledge workers in the economy.Today, management is a wide-ranging field that incorporates a variety of different approaches.

In the Gregorian calendar, which is widely used in the world today, a year is 365 days long. However, a leap year occurs every four years, when an extra day, February 29, is added to the calendar. This keeps the calendar in line with the natural rhythms of the Earth's orbit around the Sun.The word \"year\" can be used to refer to different periods of time. For example, \"school year\" usually refers to the time between September and June when children are attending school. \"Fiscal year\" or \"financial year\" refers to the 12-month period used for calculation of tax and business accounts. Meanwhile, a person's \"age\" is the number of years they have been alive.The length of a year has varied throughout history. In ancient times, astronomers used the stars to keep track of the passing of time. They observed that certain stars rose and set at fixed points throughout the year. This allowed them to divide the year into segments, which they then used to predict things like the changing of the seasons.The first attempts to define a year were made by the Babylonians, who used a lunar calendar. This meant that their year was based on the cycles of the Moon, with each month beginning on the new moon. However, this resulted in a year that was only about 354 days long. To try to fix this problem, the Babylonians introduced a leap month every so often. This helped to keep the calendar somewhat in sync with the seasons, but it was still not perfect.The Egyptians were the first to develop a solar calendar. This was based on the observation that the Sun took 365.24 days to return to the same position in the sky. This led to the creation of the 365-day year, with an extra day added every four years to account for the slightly longer solar year.The Egyptians also divided the year into 12 segments, each represented by a different deity. These segments were further divided into 30 days each. This resulted in a calendar that was very similar to the one we use today.The concept of a year has been instrumental in the development of civilisation. It has allowed us to track the passage of time, plan for the future, and make predictions about the changing of the seasons.

For example, the Appalachian Mountains are composed of a series of sedimentary rocks that were once part of a large ridge that extended along the eastern coast of North America.Ridges are an important part of the Earth's surface because they can provide a variety of ecological habitats. For example, many animal and plant species are adapted to life in the open areas of a ridge crest, where they can take advantage of the sunlight and unobstructed views.

It is an abstract concept that is used to describe the occurrent linear progression of events. Time is a fundamental element of the universe, and everything that exists is subjected to the arrow of time.Time has been a topic of philosophical speculation and scientific inquiry for centuries. Some of the most notable thinkers have attempted to define and understand time, often in terms of space.

This view of time would later be challenged by Einstein's theory of relativity, which showed that time is relative and dependent on the observer's frame of reference.Despite being a seemingly simple concept, time is notoriously difficult to define. This is likely because time is an intangible concept that cannot be directly observed or measured.

A failure to pay, or evasion of or resistance to taxation, is punishable by law. Taxes consist of direct or indirect taxes and may be paid in money or as its labour equivalent.The concept of taxation has been around since ancient times. The first use of taxes is believed to have occurred in Ancient Egypt around 3000 BCE. There are also records of taxes having been imposed in Ancient Greece and ancient Rome. Taxation has been described as \"the most powerful instrument statecraft has for remaking society\".The modern taxpayer has a number of rights under tax law: the right to know what they are being taxed for, the right to an equal and uniform tax, the right to have their property taxed only once, and the right to a rebate or refund if they overpay their taxes. These rights are set out in various international and domestic tax laws.In most jurisdictions, taxes are imposed on individuals or businesses. However, there are a few jurisdictions where taxes are imposed on other entities, such as estates and trusts. The tax imposed on an entity depends on its classification as either an individual, corporation, or other type of legal entity.Individuals are typically taxed on their income, which is typically received in the form of wages, salaries, tips, interests, dividends, and rents, among other forms. Corporations are taxed on their profits, which are typically received in the form of sales, investments, and property. Other legal entities are typically taxed on their income, which is typically received in the form of interest, dividends, and rents.The amount of tax imposed on an individual or corporation depends on the jurisdiction in which they are located. The rate of tax also depends on the classification of the entity being taxed. For example, in the United States, the federal government taxes individuals at a rate of up to 37%, while corporations are taxed at a rate of 21%. State and local governments in the United States also impose taxes, with rates varying depending on the jurisdiction.Many jurisdictions exempt certain types of income from taxation, such as charitable donations, life insurance proceeds, and inheritances. Some jurisdictions also offer tax breaks for certain activities, such as home ownership and investing in certain types of businesses.The purpose of taxation is to fund public expenditure, which includes things like roads, schools, and the military. The amount of tax collected also depends on the level of government spending. For example, when a government is engaged in a war, it will typically increase its level of spending, which will result in an increase in taxes.The history of taxation is long and complex. Taxation has been used as a tool of government policy throughout history. The modern tax system is the result of centuries of development.", "A battle is a combat between opposing military forces.

It is the act or process of imparting or acquiring general knowledge, developing the powers of reasoning and judgment, and generally of preparing oneself or others intellectually for mature life. Education may be imparted formally, as in schools, or informally, as in life experience or through media.Formal education entails face-to-face interaction between teachers and students in institutions such as schools, colleges, and universities. It encompasses both the teaching and learning of academic knowledge and skills, and social, personal, and moral development. In most cases, formal education takes place within a structured environment, with set objectives and assessment criteria.Informal education, on the other hand, is more unstructured and usually takes place outside of formal educational institutions. It can include learning that takes place through everyday life experiences, such as in the home, the workplace, or the community. It can also come through more formal channels, such as media or programs organized by nongovernmental organizations.The purpose of education is to prepare individuals to take their place in society as productive, responsible citizens. It helps them develop the skills and knowledge they need to contribute to the economy and to participate fully in the political life of their community. In addition, education fosters the development of critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills. It also promotes personal and social responsibility, and a respect for others.Education has always been a central concern of governments and societies. In the past, it was often seen as a way to prepare young people for their future roles in society. Today, education is increasingly viewed as a way to promote economic development and to provide opportunities for all members of society.There is a growing recognition that education is a basic human right. This means that everyone has a right to receive an education that meets their needs and helps them to develop their full potential.

In many parts of the world, there are insufficient resources to provide a basic education for everyone. In other cases, there is a lack of qualified teachers, or of teaching materials. In some places, girls are less likely than boys to receive an education. And in many parts of the world, people with disabilities are excluded from the education system altogether.Despite these challenges, there has been much progress in recent years in expanding access to education. In 2000, the United Nations adopted the Millennium Development Goal of ensuring that all children, everywhere, would be able to complete a primary education by the year 2015. This goal was achieved, and today, more children are enrolled in school than ever before.There is still much work to be done, however, to ensure that all children have access to a quality education.

Prices are typically determined by the market, which is based on the interaction of supply and demand.

Prices are also influenced by the level of competition in the market, as well as the perceived value of the good or service.Prices are an important part of the economy, as they provide a way for businesses to generate revenue and for consumers to make spending decisions. Prices also serve as a signal to market participants, providing information about the availability of goods and services and the level of demand.While prices are important, they can also be a source of friction in the economy. For example, when prices are too high, consumers may be reluctant to purchase goods and services, which can lead to a decrease in economic activity. Similarly, when prices are too low, businesses may be reluctant to produce goods and services, which can lead to an increase in economic activity.When prices are not in line with the underlying costs of production, it can lead to economic imbalances, such as inflation or deflation.

It is the ability to detect sound waves and interpret them as meaningful information. The ear is the organ responsible for hearing, and it is composed of three main parts: the outer ear, the middle ear, and the inner ear.The outer ear is the visible part of the ear that protrudes from the side of the head. It consists of the auricle (or pinna), which is the fleshy, cup-shaped structure that collects sound waves and funnel them into the ear canal. The ear canal is a narrow passageway that leads from the auricle to the eardrum. The eardrum is a thin membrane that vibrates when it comes into contact with sound waves.The middle ear is located behind the eardrum and is filled with air. It consists of the three tiny bones (the malleus, incus, and stapes) that transmit vibrations from the eardrum to the inner ear. The inner ear is the final stop for sound waves. It is a fluid-filled maze-like structure that contains the organ of hearing (the cochlea) and the organ of balance (the vestibular system).The cochlea is a snail-shaped structure that is filled with fluid and lined with cilia (hair-like cells). Vibrations from the middle ear cause the fluid in the cochlea to ripple, and this movement bends the cilia. This bending triggers an electrical impulse that is sent to the brain, where it is interpreted as sound.The vestibular system is responsible for maintaining balance. It is composed of the semicircular canals, which are fluid-filled channels that detect movement, and the otolith organs, which detect gravity and linear acceleration.Humans can hear a wide range of frequencies, from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. However, as we age, our hearing ability decline. This is due to a number of factors, including exposure to loud noise, disease, and aging.", "The week is a unit of time that is typically divided into seven days.

Deficits can be financed by borrowing money, but this can lead to debt and interest payments, which can impact future spending power. A deficit may also be caused by a decrease in revenue, such as when a recession leads to less tax revenue for a government. While deficits are not always a bad thing, they can become problematic if they are not managed properly.The United States has had a budget deficit every year since 2002, and the deficit has averaged 3.8% of GDP over that time. In 2009, the deficit reached a record high of 9.8% of GDP.

The deficit has continued to fall in recent years, and was 3.2% of GDP in 2018.The deficit is often a controversial topic, as there are differing opinions on how it should be managed. Some believe that the deficit should be reduced through spending cuts, while others believe that revenue should be increased through taxes or other means.

It is generally considered to be a positive trait, and is often associated with success. People who are confident often exude an air of self-assurance and seem to be able to accomplish anything they set their minds to.On the other hand, confidence can also be seen as a negative trait if it is taken to the extreme. Overly confident people can come across as cocky or arrogant, and may have difficulty taking constructive criticism. They may also find it difficult to empathize with others, as they see themselves as superior.Overall, confidence is considered to be an important trait, and one that can be beneficial in many situations.

It is the most efficient use of resources to satisfy human wants and needs. There are three main types of economies: 1) Subsistence economies are based on natural resources and are common in less developed countries. In this type of economy, people use what is available to them to survive. For example, they may grow their own food, fish, and hunt. 2) A command economy is where the government makes all the decisions about what is produced and how it is distributed. This type of economy is found in communist countries. The government owns all the resources and businesses, and it decides what to produce and how to distribute the goods and services. 3) A market economy is one in which people and businesses make most of the decisions about what is produced and how it will be distributed. This type of economy is found in capitalist countries. Resources and businesses are privately owned, and people decide what to produce and how to distribute the goods and services.In a market economy, the allocation of resources is based on the law of supply and demand. Producers supply goods and services at a price that consumers are willing to pay. The free market is a market economy in which there is little or no government regulation or intervention. In a mixed economy, the government intervenes in the market to promote economic growth and protect consumers.An economy can be categorized as developed or developing. A developed economy is one that is industrialized and has a high standard of living. A developing economy is one that is in the process of industrializing and that has a lower standard of living.The size of an economy is measured by its gross domestic product (GDP). GDP is the total value of all goods and services produced within a country in a given year. It is the most common way to measure the size of an economy.The strength of an economy is measured by its gross national product (GNP). GNP is the total value of all goods and services produced by a country in a given year, including incomes from foreign investments. GNP is a more comprehensive measure of the strength of an economy than GDP because it includes incomes from foreign investments.The health of an economy is measured by its gross national income (GNI). GNI is the total value of all incomes earned by a country's residents in a given year. It is a more comprehensive measure of the health of an economy than GDP or GNP because it includes all incomes earned by a country's residents, including incomes earned from foreign investments.The GNI of a country can be divided into four categories:1) primary income, which includes incomes from agriculture, forestry, fishing, and mining; 2) secondary income, which includes incomes from manufacturing, construction, and utilities; 3) tertiary income, which includes incomes from transportation, communications, and finance; and 4) quaternary income, which includes incomes from education, health care, and other services.A country's GNI can be further divided into five categories:1) personal incomes, which includes incomes from wages, salaries, and private pensions; 2) business incomes, which includes incomes from profits and losses; 3) government incomes, which includes incomes from taxes and fees; 4) factor incomes, which includes incomes from rents, interest, and dividends; and 5) transfer payments, which includes incomes from social security and welfare programs.", "Your circulatory system is a network of blood vessels that transport blood throughout your body. It includes your heart, which pumps blood, and your blood vessels, which carry the blood.The circulatory system is responsible for delivering oxygen and nutrients to the tissues of your body and removing carbon dioxide and other wastes. It also helps to regulate your body temperature and pH levels.Your circulatory system is made up of three main types of blood vessels: arteries, veins, and capillaries. Arteries carry blood away from your heart and towards your organs and tissues. Veins carry blood back to your heart. Capillaries are the smallest blood vessels in your body and they connect your arteries and veins.Blood circulates through your body in two main circuits: the pulmonary circuit and the systemic circuit.The pulmonary circuit carries blood from your heart to your lungs, where it picks up oxygen. The blood then returns to your heart, where it is pumped back out to the rest of your body.The systemic circuit carries blood from your heart to the rest of your body, where it delivers oxygen and nutrients. The blood then returns to your heart, where it is pumped back to your lungs to pick up more oxygen.Your heart is a muscle that pumps blood through your circulatory system. It is divided into four chambers: the right atrium, the left atrium, the right ventricle, and the left ventricle.The right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from your body and pumps it into the right ventricle. The right ventricle pumps the blood into your lungs, where it picks up oxygen.The left atrium receives oxygenated blood from your lungs and pumps it into the left ventricle. The left ventricle pumps the blood out to the rest of your body.Your heart beats about 100,000 times per day. Each time it beats, it pumps blood through your circulatory system.Your blood is made up of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Red blood cells carry oxygen and nutrients to your cells and remove carbon dioxide and other wastes. White blood cells help to fight infection. Platelets help to clot your blood.Your blood also contains plasma, which is the liquid part of your blood. Plasma is made up of water, electrolytes, nutrients, hormones, and proteins.The average adult has about 4-5 liters of blood.", "In the modern world, the word \u2018million\u2019 is used to describe a thousand thousand, or 106, of anything.

When someone expresses dissent, they are usually communicating their disapproval or disagreement with something.There are many reasons why someone might choose to express dissent. They may believe that the authority or system in question is unjust, or they may simply disagree with the opinion being put forward. In some cases, dissent may be a way of standing up for what someone believes in, or it may be a way of challenging the status quo.Dissent can take many different forms, from speaking out against a system or authority, to refusing to follow orders or participate in activities. In some cases, it may even lead to physical confrontation or violence.While dissent is often seen as a negative thing, it can also be seen as a positive force for change. When people voice their dissent, they are often doing so in an effort to bring about some kind of change. In many cases, dissent is the first step towards making progress on important issues.Despite the potential for positive change, dissent often carries with it a considerable amount of risk. People who express dissent can often face retribution from those in authority, including everything from verbal abuse to imprisonment. In some cases, dissent can even lead to death.Given the risks, it is clear that dissent is not something to be undertaken lightly. However, it is also worth noting that those who choose to express dissent are often doing so because they feel strongly about an issue, and believe that the risks are worth the potential rewards.", "R. may refer to:R., the 18th letter of the modern English alphabet and the ISO basic Latin alphabetR (programming language), a programming language for statistical computing and graphicsR, a statistical computing environmentR+, a notational variant of the musical note D\u266f\u0112r, the Retrograde of MarsR-, a variant of the letter R used in some alphabetsR, a film directed by Amitabh BachchanR, a 2006 album by DJ KrushR, a 2013 album by Ty SegallR&B, a musical genreR Kelly, an American singer, songwriter, record producer, and former professional basketball playerR&B (disambiguation)R number (disambiguation)R-type (disambiguation)R class (disambiguation)R train (disambiguation)R-class asteroid, a class of asteroidR system, a star classification systemR node, a computer network routing deviceR-selected species, a life history strategy in ecologyR value (disambiguation)R graphics, a software environment for statistical computing and graphicsR studio, an integrated development environment for RR-symmetry, a symmetry in physicsR-parity, a symmetry in supersymmetric theoriesR group, a side chain in chemistryR-phrases, warnings used on substance labelsR specified risk material, parts of cows that may contain bovine spongiform encephalopathy infectivityR black, a color in the CMYK color modelR-complex, the reptilian brainR-type calcium channel, a class of voltage-dependent calcium channelsType R, a performance version of a vehicleFlu R, a respiratory virusR area, a type of emergency area in a hospitalR-value (insulation), a measure of heat resistance in materialsR-value (thermodynamics), a ratio of heat fluxesR-value, a measure of market risk in financeR score, a prediction of university success in CanadaR Severity, a measure of software bugsReceiver operating characteristic, a graphical plotR-factor (crystallography), a measure of crystal perfectionRefractive index, a measure of the speed of light in a mediumR-file, in the Debian package management systemReduced row echelon form, a matrix operationR-film, a motion picture rating in the United StatesR-rated, a special classification for a film or video game", "Schwartz is a German surname derived from the German word \"schwarz\" meaning \"black\".

It gives us the power to buy the things we want and need, and also allows us to pay for the services we require. Money is a means of exchange, and without it, we would be stuck in a barter system where we would have to trade goods and services for other goods and services.In ancient times, people used commodities such as livestock, grains, and shells as money. Today, we use paper money and coins, which are backed by the government that issued them. We also use plastic money in the form of credit and debit cards.Most people in developed countries like the United States use fiat money, which is money that is not backed by a physical commodity. The value of fiat money is based on faith in the issuing government. For example, the United States dollar is worth more than the Mexican peso because more people have faith in the U.S. government than the Mexican government.Fiat money has advantages and disadvantages. One advantage is that it can be easily created by a government. This is helpful when a country needs to increase the money supply to stimulate the economy or to pay for wars. A disadvantage of fiat money is that it is not as stable as commodity money. The value of fiat money can go up and down in response to a variety of factors, such as inflation, economic recessions, and political instability.Some people believe that fiat money is bad because it is not backed by anything physical. They argue that this makes it prone to inflation and that it can be created out of thin air by governments, which can lead to economic problems. Other people believe that fiat money is good because it is easier to use than commodity money and because it can be created in the amounts needed to support a country's economy.", "The noun 'meantime' can refer to a period of time that is intervening between two others, or it can refer to a time that is early or middle in a larger period of time.

Crumps are often associated with explosions and other violent events.The word \"crump\" is thought to be of imitative origin, meaning that it is based on the sound that it describes. It first appears in English in the early 14th century, in a work called The Vision of William concerning Piers Plowman. In this text, the word is used to describe the sound of thunder.Over time, the word \"crump\" came to be used to describe other sharp, sudden sounds, such as the sound of a gun being fired, or an explosion. It can also be used to describe the sound of a heavy object hitting the ground, such as a tree falling over.The word \"crump\" can also be used as a verb, meaning to make a sudden, sharp sound. For example, you might crump your fist on the table to get someone's attention.In recent years, the word \"crump\" has been used informally to describe a type of dance move.

These taxes are typically used to fund government programs or to offset the cost of regulations related to the manufacturing or sale of these goods.State and local governments may also impose excise taxes. For example, many states levy an excise tax on gasoline. This tax is used to fund road and bridge construction and maintenance.

If you are trying to rent an apartment, the landlord may have certain requirements, such as a minimum income or a good credit score.In general, meeting requirements is essential in order to achieve a specific goal. Without meeting the requirements, it is often impossible to achieve the goal. For this reason, requirements are often seen as roadblocks or hurdles that must be overcome. However, if you are aware of the requirements and make a plan to meet them, they can be seen as simply another step in the process of achieving your goal.", "When you \"return\" something, you are giving it back to the person who gave it to you, or to the place where you got it. For example, if you borrow a book from the library, you must return it before your due date so somebody else can borrow it. If you \"return\" a product to a store, it means you are taking it back because it is not what you wanted, or because it is defective. Most stores have a return policy that says how long you have to return an item, and what kind of condition it must be in. When you \"return\" something to its original state, you are making it the way it was before. For example, if you paint a wall, you can return it to its original color by painting over it again. The word \"return\" can also be used as a verb meaning \"to go back.\" For example, if you are visiting a city and you take the bus back to your hotel, you can say that you have returned.

They are often printed on paper, but they can also be sent electronically.", "Correctness is the quality of being right or accurate. When something is correct, it is in accordance with facts, standards, or accepted values. Correctness can be a matter of opinion, but it can also be objective. To be objective, correctness must be based on facts, logic, and referenced standards.In many cases, correctness is a matter of opinion. What one person deems as correct may not be seen as such by another person. This is often seen in cases of social norms and customs. What is considered normal or acceptable in one culture may be viewed as odd or inappropriate in another. There are also cases where correctness is subjective, but still has a factual basis. This is often seen in matters of taste, such as in art or food. What one person finds aesthetically pleasing or delicious may not be seen as such by another.In other cases, correctness is objective. This means that it is not a matter of opinion, but is based on facts, logic, and referenced standards. This is often seen in cases of mathematics, science, or history. To be objective, correctness must be based on evidence that can be verified. This evidence must be logical and consistent, and it must be referenced to an accepted standard. For example, in mathematics, 2+2=4 is always correct, regardless of opinion. This is because it is based on a logical principle that is consistent with an accepted standard (in this case, the standard is addition).Correctness is important in many areas of life. In some cases, such as in mathematics or science, it is important for the sake of accuracy. In other cases, such as in social norms or customs, it is important for the sake of avoiding offend. In all cases, correctness is a valuable quality.", "A violation is an act that breaks a law, agreement, or code of conduct. Violations can result in punishments such as a fine, imprisonment, or community service. Some violations are minor, such as speeding, while others are more serious, such as murder.While most violations are unintentional, there are some that are deliberate. For example, people who commit tax fraud or who plagiarize deliberately break the law. In these cases, the violator knows that what they are doing is wrong and chooses to do it anyway.Violations can have a negative impact on the victim, the violator, and society as a whole. Victims of serious crimes, such as rape or robbery, can suffer physical and emotional trauma. The violator may also suffer consequences, such as losing their job or going to prison.Society also pays a price for violations. For example, property crimes cost taxpayers billions of dollars every year in lost property and damage to public infrastructure. In addition, violent crimes like murder and assault take an emotional toll on the entire community.Violations can be prevented by education, punishment, and rehabilitation. Teaching people about the law and the consequences of breaking it can deter some from committing crimes. Punishment, such as imprisonment, can also discourage others from breaking the law. Finally, rehabilitation can help those who have already committed a crime to reintegrate into society and avoid future violations.", "A penalty is a punishment that is imposed by a government or other authority for a violation of a law or rule. Penalties can be financial, such as a fine, or they can be physical, such as imprisonment.In the United States, the most common type of penalty is a fine, which is a monetary penalty that is imposed by a court for a criminal offense. For example, if someone is caught speeding, they may be fined $100.Physical penalties, such as imprisonment, are less common in the United States, but they are still imposed for certain offenses, such as murder. In some cases, a physical penalty may be combined with a financial penalty, such as when someone is sentenced to both imprisonment and a fine.Penalties can also be imposed for non-criminal offenses, such as traffic violations. For example, someone who runs a red light may be fined $200.Penalties are typically imposed by a government or other authority, but they can also be imposed by private organizations, such as businesses. For example, many businesses have policies that impose penalties on employees who violate company rules, such as by coming to work late or taking unauthorized breaks.Penalties can be an effective way to deter people from breaking laws or rules, but they can also be controversial. Some people argue that penalties are unfair because they can be imposed unfairly, such as when someone is given a harsher penalty than someone else for the same offense. Others argue that penalties are necessary in order to enforce laws and keep people safe.", "The word 'fine' has many different meanings and uses.

The steps of the scientific method include observation, hypothesis, experimentation, and analysis.Observation is the first step in the scientific method. When observing, researchers take note of anything they think might be relevant to their question.After observing, researchers form a hypothesis, which is a testable prediction about what they think is happening. For example, if a researcher observes that a plant is wilting, they might hypothesis that the plant needs water.Once a hypothesis has been formed, experimentation can begin. In the experiment, the researcher will test their hypothesis by doing something to the plant, such as watering it. They will then observe the results of the experiment and see if the plant\u2019s condition changes.After experimenting, researchers will analyze their data to see if their hypothesis was supported or not. If their hypothesis was not supported, they may go back and revise it. If their hypothesis was supported, they may continue to research to see if they can find any patterns or trends.Research is an important process that helps us to understand the world around us. It is used in many different fields, such as science, medicine, and history.

Over time, some domains expanded to become large and wealthy, while others contracted and became poorer. In many cases, lords lost control of their domains during wars or other periods of turmoil.Today, the word 'domain' is often used in a different sense, referring to a person's area of expertise or authority.

Need can be a physical requirement such as food or water, or it can be emotional such as a need for love or attention. Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs model categorizes human needs into five levels: physiological, safety, social, esteem, and self-actualization.Physiological needs are the most basic and include air, water, food, shelter, and sleep. Safety needs are the need for security and protection from physical and emotional harm. Social needs are the need for love, acceptance, and belonging. Esteem needs are the need for self-respect and respect from others. Lastly, self-actualization needs are the need to reach one's full potential.People often experience need as a feeling of emptiness, deficiency, or dissatisfaction. In other words, people feel need when something is missing in their lives. Need can drive people to take action in order to fulfill the lack. For example, a person who is thirsty will drink water to fulfill their need for hydration.Need can also be a motivating factor in humans. People often work hard to achieve things that they need or want. For example, a person may work hard to get a promotion at their job because they need the salary increase to pay their bills.Need can be a positive or negative feeling. Positive needs include things like needing to feel loved or needing to feel a sense of accomplishment. Negative needs include things like needing to feel a sense of power or needing to feel a sense of control.Some needs are basic and universal, while others are more specific to an individual. Basic, universal needs include things like air, water, and food. More specific needs might include things like the need for a certain type of job or the need to live in a certain type of environment.Needs can change over time. For example, a child's need for attention and approval from their parents changes as they become an adult and develop their own relationships. Additionally, a person's needs can change depending on their current circumstances. For example, a person who is unemployed might have a need for a job, while a person who is employed might have a need for a vacation.In conclusion, need is a feeling of lacking or requires something essential. Need can be physical, emotional, or both. People often work hard to achieve things they need or want. Some needs are basic and universal, while others are more specific.

It is often considered to be the cornerstone of a fair society. Justice is usually defined as the ability to render to each person what is due to them, or the quality of dealing fairly with others. It is often thought of as fairness, equity, and impartiality.Justice is often thought of as a blindfolded woman holding a set of scales. This image comes from the ancient Greek goddess of justice, Themis. Themis was the personification of divine order, law, and natural justice. The scales she holds represent the objectively weighed evidence for and against a person or thing. The blindfold signifies that justice is to be impartial and objective.The idea of justice is very old, and it has been discussed by philosophers for centuries. One of the earliest discussions of justice can be found in Plato's Republic. In this work, Plato discusses the nature of justice and its relationship to other virtues. He argues that justice is a necessary virtue for any society to function properly.Many different theories of justice have been developed over the years. These theories often vary in their understanding of what justice is and how it should be achieved. Some of the most prominent theories include:\u2022 Distributive justice: This theory focuses on the allocation of resources in a society. It asks the question of what is a fair distribution of resources.\u2022 Social justice: This theory focuses on the ways in which a society can be structured in a way that is fairer for everyone. It looks at things like power, privilege, and oppression.\u2022 Restorative justice: This theory focuses on the idea of repairing the harm that has been done. It looks at the ways in which people can be brought back into harmony with each other and with their community.Each of these theories has its own strengths and weaknesses. No single theory of justice is likely to be perfect. The best way to approach the question of justice is to try to understand it from multiple perspectives.The question of justice is an important one. It is central to many ethical and legal systems. It is often considered to be the cornerstone of a fair society. There is no easy answer to the question of what justice is. However, it is important to continue to think about it and to try to develop a better understanding of it.", "The term \"supreme\" is often used to describe someone or something that is the best of the best. For example, you might say that someone is the \"supreme ruler\" of a country, or that a product is the \"supreme version\" of its kind.The word \"supreme\" can also be used as an adjective to describe something that is extremely good or of the highest quality. For example, you might say that a meal was \"supremely delicious\" or that a person is \"supremely intelligent\".When used in this way, the word \"supreme\" is often seen as a positive superlative. However, it can also be used in a negative way to describe something that is the worst of the worst. For example, you might say that a person is the \"supreme ruler\" of a country because they are a dictator, or that a product is the \"supreme version\" of its kind because it is of very poor quality.In general, the word \"supreme\" is used to describe something that is the best or the worst.", "The word 'poll' is most commonly used as a noun meaning 'a public opinion survey', as in the phrase 'a poll of voters'. It can also be used as a verb, meaning 'to deliberate or discuss', as in the phrase 'we need to poll the board on this decision'.The origin of the word 'poll' is uncertain, but it is thought to be derived from the Latin word 'pullus', meaning 'chick'. This may be in reference to the voting process whereby people would put a mark next to the name of the person they wanted to vote for, which was then counted like a chicken head-count.Over time, the word 'poll' has come to be used more generally to refer to any kind of voting or public opinion survey. For example, in the United Kingdom, the ' Opinion Poll Tax' was a tax on households which included everyone over the age of 18, regardless of whether they owned property or not. The 'poll tax' was highly unpopular and was eventually abolished in 1993.In recent years, 'polling' has become increasingly important in politics as a way to gauge public opinion on various issues. For example, in the run-up to the UK General Election in 2015, pollsters were predicting a close race between the two main political parties. As it turned out, the results of the election were far from close, with the Conservative Party winning a clear majority.As well as being used to predict the outcome of elections, polls can also be used to gauge public opinion on a range of other issues. For example, a poll might be used to find out how people feel about a particular political leader, or to see what the public thinks about a particular policy.Polls are often conducted by telephone or online, and the results are usually published in the media. However, it is important to remember that polls are only a snapshot of public opinion at a particular moment in time, and they should not be seen as an accurate predictor of future events.", "When we think of the word kind, the first definition that comes to mind is likely \"a helpful, considerate, or generous act.\" And while that is certainly one meaning of the word, there are many others. According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, kind can also mean \"of a good or benevolent nature or disposition,\" \"sanitary,\" \"agreeable,\" and even \"stupid.\" As you can see, this one word can have a lot of different connotations.When we think of someone who is kind, we might picture someone who is always helping others or going out of their way to be nice. But you don't have to be a saint to be considered kind. Sometimes, simply being a good listener or being patient with someone is enough. And it's important to remember that being kind doesn't necessarily mean being a pushover. You can be assertive and still be kind.One of the great things about being kind is that it's contagious. When you see someone being kind, it can inspire you to be kind as well. And when you are kind to others, it not only makes them feel good, but it can also make you feel good about yourself.So why not try being a little more kind today?

This issue can be anything from a new law to a change in the government. Referenda are used when there is a need to get a large amount of people to vote on an issue.

April is commonly associated with the season of spring in the Northern Hemisphere and autumn in the Southern Hemisphere, in which plants (particularly trees) bloom and flower. In the Gregorian calendar, the period between March 20 (the vernal equinox) and June 21 (the summer solstice) is always 91 days long, and regularly divided into three months of 31, 30, and 31 days respectively. April is the only month with a length of 30 days.The Romans had a similar month to April which they called Aprilis. It is thought that their month was named after the Latin word aperire, which means \"to open,\" because this is the time of year when trees and flowers start to bloom. The modern English word for April comes from the Old English word Eastermona\u00fe, which means \"the month of Easter.\" The Venerable Bede, an English monk who lived in the 8th century, was the first to record this name.April remains relatively cool in most of the world, especially in the Northern Hemisphere, although temperatures are on the rise as summer approaches. The month of April typically sees the last of the frost and the start of warmer weather. In the Southern Hemisphere, April marks the beginning of autumn, which is why the month is often associated with cooler temperatures.April is considered a lucky month in many cultures. In ancient Rome, the festival of Cerealia was held in April to honor the goddess Ceres. This was a time of feasting and celebration, and it was believed that the goddess would bestow good fortune on those who honored her. In the Middle Ages, many countries had a custom of choosing a king or queen of May, who would rule over the springtime festivities.In the modern day, April Fool's Day is celebrated in many countries on the first of the month. This tradition is thought to have started in France, although the specific origin is unknown. On this day, people play tricks on each other and try to make each other believe false information.April is also the month in which many major holidays are celebrated, such as Easter, Passover, and the Muslim holiday of Ramadan. For Christians, Easter is the most important holiday, as it commemorates the resurrection of Jesus Christ. The date of Easter changes each year, but it is always celebrated in April.

In terms of geography, the West is a general term used to describe the Western hemisphere of the globe, which includes Europe, the Americas, and parts of Africa and Asia. The West is often considered a developed region in contrast to the East, which is typically seen as underdeveloped or Third World.There is no one definitive answer for why the West is considered developed and the East is not. However, some theories suggest that it is due to thehistorical colonial domination of the East by the West, which led to a transfer of knowledge, technology, and resources that allowed the West to grow and develop while the East lagged behind. Other theories attribute the differences to the climate and geography of the two regions, with the West being more geographically and climatically conducive to development.Whatever the reason, the fact remains that the West is generally seen as a more developed region than the East. This is reflected in the standard of living of residents in the two regions, with those in the West typically enjoying a higher quality of life than those in the East. This is due to a number of factors, including access to better education, healthcare, and infrastructure.The West also has a long history of democracy and political stability, which has allowed for the development of strong institutions and a thriving economy.

It is the power of making a decision. The decision can be made between two or more things, options, people, subjects, etc. It is the freedom to choose and the power to decide. The ability to make choices is something that separates humans from other animals. Some argue that it is a fundamental human right. The ability to choose allows humans to control their own destiny. It is an important part of our autonomy and our ability to determine our own fate. Making choices can be difficult. We often have to weigh the pros and cons of our options and decide which is the best for us. Sometimes we make choices based on our gut instinct or intuition. Other times we carefully consider all the facts and make a logical choice. There are all sorts of choices we have to make in life, big and small. What career to pursue, who to marry, whether or not to have children, where to live, what kind of house or car to buy... the list goes on and on. Some of these choices are easy, while others are very difficult. Choice is a word that is also often used in the context of abortion.

Cotton is a versatile fabric that is comfortable to wear in warm weather and can be easily dyed in a variety of colors. It is a durable fabric that does not pill or fade with washing.Cotton was first domesticated in the Americas over 5,000 years ago. The earliest cotton fabrics were made into simple items such as bags and towels. Cotton became an important commodity in the 18th and 19th centuries with the growth of the Atlantic slave trade. British colonists in India and the American South cultivated large plantations of cotton, which were worked by enslaved Africans. The American Civil War (1861-1865) was fought in part over the issue of slavery, and after the Union victory, cotton production in the United States declined sharply.Today, most of the world's cotton is grown in India, China, and the United States. Cotton is a labor-intensive crop, and the majority of cotton workers are paid very low wages. Child labor is still common in the cotton industry, despite efforts to eradicate it. Environmentalists have criticized the heavy use of pesticides and other chemicals in cotton production, which can pollute nearby water supplies.Despite these concerns, cotton remains a popular fabric due to its comfort, durability, and versatility.

For example, one could look at the market value of something. In this case, worth would be based on how much money someone is willing to pay for the item. However, this approach does not always work well because not everything has a market value. Other things, like love or comfort, cannot be measured in terms of money.One approach to finding worth is to look at how much effort it takes to acquire or produce something. This is often how people determine the worth of their time. If something is difficult or time-consuming to acquire, it is often deemed more valuable. However, this method is not perfect either because some things that are easy to acquire can be very valuable (e.g. water).It is clear that worth is a complex concept with no easy definition. However, it is possible to say that something is worth a certain amount if it is important, useful, or valuable to someone.", "One of the most admirable qualities a person can have is wisdom.

In many countries, a hamlet is a rural settlement of fewer than 200 residents. However, in some countries (such as the United Kingdom), a hamlet may be a village without a church.The word hamlet is derived from Old English operations. By the late 12th century, the word had come to refer to a small village or settlement. In medieval England, a hamlet was typically a village or group of houses surrounded by farmland.Today, hamlets are found in both rural and urban areas. In some parts of the world, hamlets are the only type of settlement. In other parts, hamlets are part of larger towns or cities.Hamlets often have a close-knit community feel. Residents may know each other well and rely on each other for support. This feeling of community can be one of the most appealing aspects of living in a hamlet.However, hamlets can also have disadvantages. Due to their small size, hamlets often lack essential services such as schools, hospitals, and supermarkets. This can make everyday life more difficult for residents.In conclusion, a hamlet is a small town or village. It can be a rural or urban settlement.

In some countries, the president also has the power to dissolve parliament and call new elections.The origins of the presidency can be traced back to Ancient Greece, where the position of archon was a powerful role in the city-state of Athens. The modern presidency first developed in England, during the medieval period, when the King would appoint someone to represent him in his absence. This practice eventually spread to other European countries.The first modern president was George Washington, who was sworn in as the first president of the United States in 1789.

The type of defense employed will depend on the nature of the threat, the geographical terrain, and the country's available resources.In some cases, defense may be the only option available to a country. When a country is facing an overwhelming force, it may be necessary to mount a defense in order to buy time for reinforcements to arrive or for a diplomatic solution to be reached. In other cases, a country may elect to go on the offensive, either to preemptively strike an adversary or to respond to an aggression.The success of a defense depends on a number of factors, including the quality of the defense forces, the effectiveness of the defensive plan, and the willingness of the defenders to fight. A well-trained and disciplined force, supported by a robust defensive infrastructure, has a better chance of success than a force that is poorly equipped and poorly prepared.A good defense also requires a good offense. A country that is able to project power and to threaten retaliation is more likely to deter an attack than one that is seen as weak and vulnerable.In the end, however, the success of a defense ultimately depends on the resolve of the defenders.

It is also home to renowned universities such as the Humboldt University, the Technical University, and the Free University. Berlin is an Alpha World City and was ranked sixth in the 2011 Global Cities Index. The name Berlin has its roots in the language of West Slavic inhabitants of the area of today's Berlin, and may be related to the Old Polabian stem berl-/birl-. Since the first half of the 19th century, the name has been from its West Slavic origin.The metropolis experienced its Golden Age during theWeimar Republic era, when it was the host city of the 1920 Summer Olympics. In addition, Berlin hosted the 1936 Summer Olympics. It has also been proposed that Berlin be nominated as the European Capital of Culture in 2020.The earliest evidence of humans in the area now known as Berlin is the result of recent finds of Neanderthal bones. The Berlin area was inhabited by Germanic tribes since the 4th century, when the settlements of the Mark Brandenburg were founded by the Saxons. During the 10th century, the area around the later Old Town of Berlin, including today's Spandau, Zehlendorf and Wedding, was settled by the Polabian Slavs. The gradually realized eastward expansion of the Frankish Empire from Aachen led, from the 9th century on, to the Saxon Eastern March, which established the Saxon presence in the northeast of today's Germany.The foundation of the German state by Karl the Great in the 9th century, as well as the foundation of the bishoprics of Brandenburg (948) and of Havelberg (946), brought the settlements West and East of today's Berlin under German rule.

For example, solids are made of particles that are very close together. They can only vibrate in place. Liquids are made of particles that are close together, but can move around each other. Gases are made of particles that are far apart and can move around freely.The states of matter are determined by the forces between particles. In a solid, the particles are held together by strong forces. In a liquid, the particles are held together by weaker forces. In a gas, the particles are not held together by any forces.The states of matter can be changed. For example, water can be a solid (ice), a liquid, or a gas (vapor). The change from one state to another is called a phase change.Phase changes happen when the amount of energy in matter changes. When matter gains energy, it changes to a higher state.

Both of these treaties have been supplemented by a number of Optional Protocols.In addition to these international instruments, there are a number of regional human rights treaties, such as the European Convention on Human Rights, the American Convention on Human Rights, and the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights. There are also a number of national Constitutions that guarantee human rights, and an increasing number of countries are incorporating human rights norms into their domestic legal systems.The enforcement of human rights is primarily the responsibility of national governments, but there are a number of international and regional bodies that play a role in monitoring compliance and providing assistance where needed. The most important of these is the United Nations human rights machinery, which includes the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and a number of treaty-based monitoring bodies.The concept of human rights has been criticized on a number of grounds, including the argument that it is a Western construct that is inappropriately imposed on non-Western cultures, and the claim that the notion of universal human rights is a cover for Western imperialism.

A room usually has walls, a floor, and a ceiling. Most rooms also have doors and windows. The term \"room\" can also refer to the space that is available for a particular activity. For example, a classroom is a room where people learn. A kitchen is a room where people cook food.The word \"room\" is derived from the Old English word \"rum,\" which means \"space.\" \"Room\" first appeared in print in the early 14th century. At that time, the word was used to describe both physical spaces and the emptiness within them. The meaning of the word has changed over time, and it is now primarily used to refer to a physical space.There are many different types of rooms, and each one serves a different purpose. Some rooms, such as bedrooms and living rooms, are designed for relaxation. Other rooms, such as kitchens and bathrooms, are designed for practical purposes. Still other rooms, such as offices and libraries, are designed for work or study.Most rooms are decorated according to the purpose they serve. Bedrooms, for example, often have soft, comfortable furniture and a calming color scheme. In contrast, offices often have sleek, modern furniture and a more vibrant color scheme.The size of a room can also vary depending on its purpose. Some rooms, such as closets and bathrooms, are small. Others, such as living rooms and ballrooms, are much larger.When choosing furniture for a room, it is important to consider the size and shape of the space.

It is a systematic way of doing things. There are many different types of processes, such as manufacturing processes, business processes, and natural processes. Processes can be either static or dynamic. Static processes are those that always happen in the same way, such as the process of photosynthesis. Dynamic processes are those that can change over time, such as the process of cell division.Processes are made up of three main components: inputs, outputs, and a set of rules or instructions. Inputs are the resources that are required in order to carry out the process. Outputs are the results of the process. The set of rules or instructions determine the order in which the activities are carried out.Processes can be represented using flowcharts. Flowcharts show the sequence of activities in a process, as well as the inputs and outputs for each activity. They can be used to map out a process so that it can be more easily understood and improved.Processes are an important part of many different fields, such as engineering, manufacturing, and business. They are used to create products, provide services, and carry out research. By understanding and improving processes, we can increase efficiency and improve quality.", "Contempt is the act of despising someone or something. It can be felt or shown towards someone who is considered to be beneath you, or someone who has done something that you deem to be worthy of contempt. It is also used to describe the feeling of general dislike or distaste. Contempt is often seen as a negative emotion, and is often associated with feelings of superiority, anger, and disrespect. However, it can also be seen as a positive emotion in some instances. For example, if someone is experiencing contempt for a person who has hurt them, it may be seen as a way of protecting themselves from further harm. There are many different reasons why someone may feel contempt towards someone else. In some cases, it may be due to a difference in values or beliefs. In other cases, it may be due to a feeling of being undervalued or disrespected. It can also be a reaction to someone else's behaviour that is seen as unacceptable.

If someone is feeling contemptuous towards someone else, it is important to try to understand the reasons behind it. This can help to resolve the issue and improve the relationship.", "A function is a set of mathematical instructions that can be used to calculate an output from a given input. Functions can be linear or nonlinear, and they can be represented in mathematical notation using the function notation f(x). Functions can be graphed on a coordinate plane, and the inputs and outputs can be real numbers, complex numbers, or vectors. Functions can be used to model physical phenomena, and they can be used to solve mathematical problems.Linear functions are functions where the inputs and outputs are proportional to each other. In other words, if the input is doubled, the output is also doubled. Linear functions can be represented in mathematical notation using the function notation f(x)=mx+b, where x is the input, m is the slope of the line, and b is the y-intercept. Nonlinear functions are functions where the inputs and outputs are not proportional to each other. In other words, if the input is doubled, the output is not necessarily doubled. Nonlinear functions can be represented in mathematical notation using the function notation f(x)=ax^b+c, where x is the input, a is the coefficient, b is the exponent, and c is the y-intercept.Functions can be graphed on a coordinate plane using the function notation f(x)=y. The x-axis is the input axis and the y-axis is the output axis. The graph of a function will be a line if the function is linear and a curve if the function is nonlinear. The inputs and outputs can be real numbers, complex numbers, or vectors. Functions can be used to model physical phenomena, and they can be used to solve mathematical problems.The domain of a function is the set of all input values for which the function produces a result, and the range of a function is the set of all output values for which the function produces a result. The domain and range can be represented in mathematical notation using set notation. For example, the domain of the function f(x)=x^2+1 is the set of all real numbers, and the range of the function is the set of all positive real numbers.Functions can be classified according to their behavior as increasing, decreasing, or constant. An increasing function is a function where the output values increase as the input values increase. A decreasing function is a function where the output values decrease as the input values increase. A constant function is a function where the output values do not change as the input values change. Functions can also be classified according to their properties as one-to-one, onto, or neither. A one-to-one function is a function where each input value corresponds to a unique output value. An onto function is a function where each output value is the result of some input value. A function that is neither one-to-one nor onto is a function where some input values correspond to more than one output value or some output values are not the result of any input value.The inverse of a function is a function that \"undoes\" the original function. The inverse of a function is usually represented in mathematical notation using the function notation f^-1(x). For example, the inverse of the function f(x)=x^2 is the function f^-1(x)=sqrt(x).A function is a set of mathematical instructions that can be used to calculate an output from a given input. Functions can be linear or nonlinear, and they can be represented in mathematical notation using the function notation f(x).

The main East Asian countries are China, Japan, and South Korea. Other countries sometimes included in East Asia are Mongolia, North Korea, and Taiwan. The Eastern world is also home to many of the world\u2019s major religions, including Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, and Islam.The region known as the East has a long and complex history. The first civilizations in the world emerged in the East, and the region has been home to some of the most powerful empires in history. The East has also been a major center of trade and cultural exchange for thousands of years. In recent centuries, the East has undergone tremendous changes, as Western powers have exerted influence and control over much of the region.The term \u201cEast\u201d is often used in contrast to the \u201cWest,\u201d which is usually taken to mean Europe and the Americas. The East-West divide has been a source of tension and conflict throughout history. In recent years, however, the importance of the East has been increasing, as the region has become more economically and politically powerful.", "Precedent (noun): an act or instance that may be used as an example or rule to authorize or justify a subsequent act of the same or a similar kind; a legal precedent.The word precedent can trace its origins back to the Latin word praecedens, which means \u201cgoing before.\u201d In the legal world, a precedent is a previous decision or set of decisions that a court or tribunal may use when hearing a subsequent case that has similar facts or issues. In other words, precedent provides a basis for future decision-making.There are two types of precedent: binding and persuasive. Binding precedent is precedent that a court is obliged to follow. For example, if a court of appeals has previously ruled on a case that is similar to the one currently before it, the court of appeals is bound by its own precedent and must rule in the same manner. Persuasive precedent, on the other hand, is precedent that a court may choose to follow but is not required to do so.In the United States, binding precedent is created by the decisions of the Supreme Court, as well as by the decisions of lower federal courts when they are interpreting the Constitution. State courts may also create binding precedent, but they are not required to do so. In fact, many state courts choose to follow the decisions of other state courts or the federal courts.The doctrine of stare decisis is the legal principle that requires courts to follow precedent. The Latin phrase stare decisis means \u201cto stand by things decided.\u201d Under this doctrine, once a court has decided a case, it will generally follow that decision in future cases involving similar facts and issues.The doctrine of stare decisis is not absolute, however. There are several circumstances under which a court may choose to deviate from precedent. For example, a court may choose to overrule a previous decision if it believes that the decision was incorrect. A court may also choose to distinguish a previous decision if the facts of the current case are sufficiently different from the facts of the case that served as precedent.The doctrine of stare decisis is important because it promotes predictability, stability, and fairness in the legal system. If courts were free to ignore precedent at will, the law would be constantly in flux and it would be very difficult for people to know what to expect from the legal system. The doctrine of stare decisis also helps to ensure that similar cases are treated similarly and that different cases are treated differently. This promotes fairness because it allows people to know in advance how their case is likely to be decided.While the doctrine of stare decisis is important, it is not absolute. There are times when a court may choose to deviate from precedent. However, in general, the doctrine of stare decisis provides a strong presumption in favor of precedent.", "A statement is a piece of writing that makes a claim or declaration about something.

Fixed costs are costs that do not change with the level of output. For example, the rent for a factory is a fixed cost. Variable costs are costs that do change with the level of output. For example, the cost of materials to make a product is a variable cost.In accounting, there are three types of cost: direct costs, indirect costs, and opportunity costs.Direct costs are costs that can be directly traced to the production of a good or service. For example, the cost of the materials used to make a product is a direct cost. Indirect costs are costs that cannot be directly traced to the production of a good or service. For example, the cost of the electricity used to power the factory is an indirect cost. Opportunity costs are the costs of the alternatives that were not chosen. For example, if a company decides to build a new factory, the cost of the lost potential sales is an opportunity cost.In economics, there is a fourth type of cost: sunk costs. Sunk costs are costs that have already been incurred and cannot be recovered. For example, the cost of the land for a new factory is a sunk cost.In decision-making, it is important to consider all of the costs, both financial and non-financial, when making a decision.

However, it can be difficult to differentiate between malingering and actual mental or physical illness, as the line between the two is often blurred. This is particularly true in cases where an individual is both physically and mentally unwell.There are a number of ways to detect malingering, which can help to confirm or rule out a diagnosis. One method is to look for inconsistencies in an individual's story. For example, if someone claiming to have a back injury is able to walk without pain, this may be an indication that they are malingering.Other signs of malingering include exaggeration of symptoms, unwillingness to cooperate with testing or treatment, and a sudden onset of symptoms that are not consistent with the illness or injury being claimed.If malingering is suspected, it is important to rule out any underlying physical or mental health conditions that could be causing the individual to behave in this way. Once any underlying conditions have been ruled out, a diagnosis of malingering can be made.While malingering is not a crime, it can have serious consequences. For example, if someone is malingering in order to avoid military service, they may be putting themselves and others at risk.

It is usually defined within the context of a specific land-use application, such as agriculture, grazing, forestry, or urban planning. The term can also be used more broadly, as in the case of a field of study, or a field of inquiry.The word \"field\" comes from the Old English word feld, which means \"open country.\" The concept of a field has been present in human societies since the dawn of agriculture, when our ancestors first began to settle down and cultivate the land. In the millennia since then, the use and meaning of the word \"field\" has evolved to meet the needs of a changing world.Today, fields are an integral part of our lives. They provide us with the food we eat, the materials we use to build our homes and roads, and the spaces where we play and relax. They are also the places where we conduct important research and make important discoveries.Fields will continue to be a vital part of our lives in the future. As we face the challenges of a changing climate and a growing population, we will need to use fields more efficiently and creatively.

Empirical knowledge is often seen as more reliable, since it is based on data that can be observed and verified. Theoretical knowledge is often seen as less reliable, since it is based on assumptions that may not be true.There are different types of knowledge, such as declarative knowledge, which is knowledge that can be stated or declared; procedural knowledge, which is knowledge of how to do something; and factual knowledge, which is knowledge of facts or information.Knowledge is acquired in different ways, such as through education, experience, or research. It can be acquired passively, such as through listening to a lecture, or actively, such as through reading a book.Knowledge is important because it allows us to understand the world around us and make better decisions.

The party is also commonly referred to as the GOP, which stands for \"Grand Old Party.\" The party's platform generally focuses on conservatism, fiscal responsibility, and social values. The party has also been known to support limited government and a strong national defense.The Republican Party traces its roots back to the anti-slavery movement in the 1830s. The party was officially founded in 1854 by a group ofAnti-Slavery activists in Ripon, Wisconsin. The party's first president was Abraham Lincoln, who was elected in 1860. Lincoln's election marked a turning point in American history, as it ushered in a new era of Civil War and Reconstruction.In the years following the Civil War, the Republican Party became the party of big business and laissez-faire capitalism. The party's support for big business and industry made it unpopular with farmers and laborers, and the party began to lose support in the late 1800s. The election of 1896 was a turning point for the party, as Republican William McKinley defeated Democrat William Jennings Bryan. McKinley's victory signaled a return to conservative values and a focus on economic growth.The early 1900s were a period of political and economic turmoil, and the Republican Party was unable to maintain control of the Presidency. The election of 1912 was a turning point for the party, as Theodore Roosevelt, a former Republican, ran on the Progressive Party ticket and won. Roosevelt's victory signaled a move away from the party's conservative roots and a move toward more progressive policies.The Republican Party regained control of the Presidency in 1920, and the party would go on to hold the Presidency for most of the next two decades. The Great Depression of the 1930s dealt a blow to the party, and Democrat Franklin Roosevelt was elected in 1932. Roosevelt's New Deal policies expanded the role of the federal government and led to a realignment of the political parties. The New Deal Coalition of Democrats and liberals was opposed by the conservative coalition of Republicans and southern Democrats.The election of 1952 was a turning point for the Republican Party, as Dwight Eisenhower was elected President. Eisenhower's victory signaled a return to the party's conservative roots and a focus on national security. The election of 1980 was another turning point for the party, as Ronald Reagan was elected President. Reagan's election ushered in a new era of conservatism, and the party has been associated with conservative values ever since.", "In military science, a halleck is a functional equivalent to a commanding general or theater commander.

The pressure on an object is equal to the force applied to it divided by the area over which the force is applied. The SI unit of pressure is the pascal (Pa), which is equal to one newton per square metre (N/m2).Pressure is a scalar quantity, which means that it has a magnitude but no direction. It is often used to represent the amount of force that is exerted by a fluid on a surface. The pressure of a fluid is caused by the weight of the fluid and the acceleration due to gravity.The pressure of a fluid also depends on the density of the fluid and the temperature. For example, the pressure of a gas is usually greater than the pressure of a liquid. The pressure of a gas is also affected by its compressibility.The pressure of a fluid can be measured using a manometer. A manometer is a tube with a U-shaped bend in it. The fluid is placed in the U-shaped tube and the pressure is measured by the height of the fluid in the tube.The atmospheric pressure is the pressure of the atmosphere on the surface of the Earth. The atmospheric pressure is caused by the weight of the air in the atmosphere. The atmospheric pressure is normally about 101.3 kilopascals (kPa).The atmospheric pressure can be measured using a barometer. A barometer is a tube with a mercury-filled reservoir at the bottom. The atmospheric pressure is measured by the height of the mercury in the tube.", "The word 'tonight' has many different connotations.

The word can also be used to refer to the act of providing people with a place to live. Housing is a basic human need and is essential for human beings to survive and thrive.There are many different types of housing, from simple tents and huts to complex buildings with multiple levels and sophisticated features. The type of housing that people live in depends on a variety of factors, including climate, available resources, and personal preferences.In most cases, housing is created using materials that are readily available in the local environment. For example, people who live in cold climates may use wood and stone to build sturdy homes that will protect them from the elements. In warm climates, people may use materials like straw and mud to construct homes that will stay cool in the heat.Housing can also be influence by cultural factors. In some cultures, homes are built around a central courtyard, while in others, homes are built with multiple rooms that are arranged in a linear fashion.The way that housing is organized can also vary from place to place.

The Saxons had already established the districts that became the historic counties of England, calling them shires; many county names derive from the name of the county town (county seat) with the word shire added on: for example, Gloucestershire and Worcestershire. The Anglo-Saxon terms earl and earldom were taken as equivalent to the continental terms \"count\" and \"county\" under the conquering Normans, and over time the two blended and became equivalent. Further, the later-imported term became a synonym for the native Old English word s\u010b\u012br ([\u0283i\u02d0r]) or, in Modern English, shire \u2013 an equivalent administrative division of the kingdom.

Elections may fill offices in the legislature, sometimes in the executive and judiciary, and for regional and local government. This process is also used in many other private and business organisations, from clubs to voluntary associations and corporations.The global use of elections as a tool for selecting representatives in modern representative democracies is in contrast with the practice in the democratic archetype, ancient Athens, where the elections were considered an oligarchic institution and most political offices were filled using sortition, also known as allotment, by which officeholders were chosen by lot.Electoral reform describes the process of introducing fair electoral systems where they are not in place, or improving the fairness or effectiveness of existing systems.

It is usually understood as an indication that the supported proposition is true. What role evidence plays and how it is conceived varies from field to field.In epistemology, evidence is what justifies beliefs or what makes it rational to hold a certain doxastic attitude. For example, a perceptual experience of a tree may act as evidence that justifies the belief that there is a tree. In this role, evidence is usually understood as a private mental state. Important topics in this field include the questions of what the nature of these mental states is, for example, whether they have to be propositional, and whether misleading mental states can still qualify as evidence. In phenomenology, evidence is understood in a similar sense. Here, however, it is limited to intuitive knowledge that provides immediate access to truth and is therefore indubitable. In this role, it is supposed to provide ultimate justifications for basic philosophical principles and thus turn philosophy into a rigorous science. However, it is highly controversial whether evidence can meet these requirements. Other fields, including the sciences and the law, tend to emphasize more the public nature of evidence (for example, scientists tend to focus on how the data used during statistical inference are generated). In philosophy of science, evidence is understood as that which confirms or disconfirms scientific hypotheses. Measurements of Mercury's \"anomalous\" orbit, for example, are seen as evidence that confirms Einstein's theory of general relativity. In order to play the role of neutral arbiter between competing theories, it is important that scientific evidence is public and uncontroversial, like observable physical objects or events, so that the proponents of the different theories can agree on what the evidence is. This is ensured by following the scientific method and tends.", "Architecture criticism is the critique of architecture.

It is distinct from a fee which the borrower may pay the lender or some third party. It is also distinct from dividend which is paid by a company to its shareholders (owners) from its profit or reserve, but not at a particular rate decided beforehand, rather on a pro rata basis as a share in the reward gained by risk taking entrepreneurs when the revenue earned exceeds the total costs.For example, a customer would usually pay interest to borrow from a bank, so they pay the bank an amount which is more than the amount they borrowed; or a customer may earn interest on their savings, and so they may withdraw more than they originally deposited. In the case of savings, the customer is the lender, and the bank plays the role of the borrower.Interest differs from profit, in that interest is received by a lender, whereas profit is received by the owner of an asset, investment or enterprise. (Interest may be part or the whole of the profit on an investment, but the two concepts are distinct from each other from an accounting perspective.)The rate of interest is equal to the interest amount paid or received over a particular period divided by the principal sum borrowed or lent (usually expressed as a percentage).Compound interest means that interest is earned on prior interest.", "A number is a mathematical object used to count, measure, and label. The original examples are the natural numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and so forth. Numbers can be represented in language with number words. More universally, individual numbers can be represented by symbols, called numerals; for example, \"5\" is a numeral that represents the number five. As only a relatively small number of symbols can be memorized, basic numerals are commonly organized in a numeral system, which is an organized way to represent any number. The most common numeral system is the Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system, which allows for the representation of any number using a combination of ten fundamental numeric symbols, called digits. In addition to their use in counting and measuring, numerals are often used for labels (as with telephone numbers), for ordering (as with serial numbers), and for codes (as with ISBNs). In common usage, a numeral is not clearly distinguished from the number that it represents.In mathematics, the notion of a number has been extended over the centuries to include zero (0), negative numbers, rational numbers such as one half      .", "Size in general is the magnitude or dimensions of a thing. More specifically, geometrical size (or spatial size) can refer to linear dimensions (length, width, height, diameter, perimeter), area, or volume. Size can also be measured in terms of mass, especially when assuming a density range.\n\nIn mathematical terms, \"size is a concept abstracted from the process of measuring by comparing a longer to a shorter\". Size is determined by the process of comparing or measuring objects, which results in the determination of the magnitude of a quantity, such as length or mass, relative to a unit of measurement. Such a magnitude is usually expressed as a numerical value of units on a previously established spatial scale, such as meters or inches.\nThe sizes with which humans tend to be most familiar are body dimensions (measures of anthropometry), which include measures such as human height and human body weight. These measures can, in the aggregate, allow the generation of commercially useful distributions of products that accommodate expected body sizes, as with the creation of clothing sizes and shoe sizes, and with the standardization of door frame dimensions, ceiling heights, and bed sizes. The human experience of size can lead to a psychological tendency towards size bias, wherein the relative importance or perceived complexity of organisms and other objects is judged based on their size relative to humans, and particularly whether this size makes them easy to observe without aid.", "A city is a human settlement of notable size. It can be defined as a permanent and densely settled place with administratively defined boundaries whose members work primarily on non-agricultural tasks. Cities generally have extensive systems for housing, transportation, sanitation, utilities, land use, production of goods, and communication. Their density facilitates interaction between people, government organisations and businesses, sometimes benefiting different parties in the process, such as improving efficiency of goods and service distribution.Historically, city-dwellers have been a small proportion of humanity overall, but following two centuries of unprecedented and rapid urbanization, more than half of the world population now lives in cities, which has had profound consequences for global sustainability. Present-day cities usually form the core of larger metropolitan areas and urban areas\u2014creating numerous commuters traveling towards city centres for employment, entertainment, and education. However, in a world of intensifying globalization, all cities are to varying degrees also connected globally beyond these regions. This increased influence means that cities also have significant influences on global issues, such as sustainable development, global warming, and global.", "Purchasing is the process a business or organization uses to acquire goods or services to accomplish its goals.

In a more general sense, it is the ability to do things well, successfully, and without waste.In more mathematical or scientific terms, it signifies the level of performance that uses the least amount of inputs to achieve the highest amount of output. It often specifically comprises the capability of a specific application of effort to produce a specific outcome with a minimum amount or quantity of waste, expense, or unnecessary effort. Efficiency refers to very different inputs and outputs in different fields and industries. In 2019, the European Commission said: \"Resource efficiency means using the Earth's limited resources in a sustainable manner while minimising impacts on the environment. It allows us to create more with less and to deliver greater value with less input.\"Writer Deborah Stone notes that efficiency is \"not a goal in itself. It is not something we want for its own sake, but rather because it helps us attain more of the things we value.\"\n\n", "In production, research, retail, and accounting, a cost is the value of money that has been used up to produce something or deliver a service, and hence is not available for use anymore. In business, the cost may be one of acquisition, in which case the amount of money expended to acquire it is counted as cost. In this case, money is the input that is gone in order to acquire the thing. This acquisition cost may be the sum of the cost of production as incurred by the original producer, and further costs of transaction as incurred by the acquirer over and above the price paid to the producer. Usually, the price also includes a mark-up for profit over the cost of production.\nMore generalized in the field of economics, cost is a metric that is totaling up as a result of a process or as a differential for the result of a decision.  Hence cost is the metric used in the standard modeling paradigm applied to economic processes.\nCosts (pl.) are often further described based on their timing or their applicability.", "Academic administration is a branch of university or college employees responsible for the maintenance and supervision of the institution and separate from the faculty or academics, although some personnel may have joint responsibilities.

Sometimes divisions are coarser: a liberal arts college which de-emphasizes the sciences may have a single Science department; an engineering university may have one department for Language and Literature (in all languages).  Sometimes divisions may be finer: for example, Harvard University  has separate departments of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology, Molecular and Cellular Biology, and Chemistry and Chemical Biology.

It has been variously described as a science and as the art of justice. State-enforced laws can be made by a group legislature or by a single legislator, resulting in statutes; by the executive through decrees and regulations; or established by judges through precedent, usually in common law jurisdictions. Private individuals may create legally binding contracts, including arbitration agreements that adopt alternative ways of resolving disputes to standard court litigation. The creation of laws themselves may be influenced by a constitution, written or tacit, and the rights encoded therein. The law shapes politics, economics, history and society in various ways and also serves as a mediator of relations between people.Legal systems vary between jurisdictions, with their differences analysed in comparative law. In civil law jurisdictions, a legislature or other central body codifies and consolidates the law. In common law systems, judges may make binding case law through precedent, although on occasion this may be overturned by a higher court or the legislature. Historically, religious law has influenced secular matters  and is, as of the 21st century, still in use in some religious communities.

Depending on the substances alight, and any impurities outside, the color of the flame and the fire's intensity will be different.Fire in its most common form can result in conflagration, which has the potential to cause physical damage through burning. Fire is an important process that affects ecological systems around the globe. The positive effects of fire include stimulating growth and maintaining various ecological systems.\nIts negative effects include hazard to life and property, atmospheric pollution, and water contamination. If fire removes protective vegetation, heavy rainfall may lead to an increase in soil erosion by water. Also, when vegetation is burned, the nitrogen it contains is released into the atmosphere, unlike elements such as potassium and phosphorus which remain in the ash and are quickly recycled into the soil. This loss of nitrogen caused by a fire produces a long-term reduction in the fertility of the soil, which can be recovered as atmospheric nitrogen is fixed and converted to ammonia by natural phenomena such as lightning or by leguminous plants such as clover, peas, and green beans.\nFire is one of the four classical elements and has been used by humans in rituals, in agriculture for clearing land, for cooking, generating heat and light, for signaling, propulsion purposes, smelting, forging, incineration of waste, cremation, and as a weapon or mode of destruction.", "The appointment of bishops in the Catholic Church is a complicated process.

Airports usually consist of a landing area, which comprises an aerially accessible open space including at least one operationally active surface such as a runway for a plane to take off and to land or a helipad, and often includes adjacent utility buildings such as control towers, hangars and terminals, to maintain and monitor aircraft. Larger airports may have airport aprons, taxiway bridges, air traffic control centres, passenger facilities such as restaurants and lounges, and emergency services. In some countries, the US in particular, airports also typically have one or more fixed-base operators, serving general aviation.\nOperating airports is extremely complicated, with a complex system of aircraft support services, passenger services, and aircraft control services contained within the operation. Thus airports can be major employers, as well as important hubs for tourism and other kinds of transit. Because they are sites of operation for heavy machinery, a number of regulations and safety measures have been implemented in airports, in order to reduce hazards. Additionally, airports have major local environmental impacts, as both large sources of air pollution, noise pollution and other environmental impacts, making them sites that acutely experience the environmental effects of aviation. Airports are also vulnerable infrastructure to extreme weather, climate change caused sea level rise and other disasters.", "Management (or managing) is the administration of organizations, whether they are a business, a nonprofit organization, or a government body. It is the art and science of managing resources of the business. Management includes the activities of setting the strategy of an organization and coordinating the efforts of its employees (or of volunteers) to accomplish its objectives through the application of available resources, such as financial, natural, technological, and human resources. \"Run the business\" and \"Change the business\" are two concepts that are used in management to differentiate between the continued delivery of goods or services and adapting of goods or services to meet the changing needs of customers - see trend. The term \"management\" may also refer to those people who manage an organization\u2014managers. Some people study management at colleges or universities; major degrees in management includes the Bachelor of Commerce (B.Com.), Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA.), Master of Business Administration (MBA.), Master in Management (MSM or MIM) and, for the public sector, the Master of Public Administration (MPA) degree. Individuals who aim to become management specialists or experts, management researchers, or professors may complete the Doctor of Management (DM), the Doctor of Business Administration (DBA), or the PhD in Business Administration or Management. In the past few decades, there has been a movement for evidence-based management.Larger organizations generally have three hierarchical levels of managers, in a pyramid structure:Senior managers such as members of a board of directors and a chief executive officer (CEO) or a president of an organization sets the strategic goals and policy of the organization and make decisions on how the overall organization will operate. Senior managers are generally executive-level professionals who provide direction to middle management, and directly or indirectly report to them.Middle managers such as branch managers, regional managers, department managers, and section managers, who provide direction to the front-line managers.

In setting prices, the business will take into account the price at which it could acquire the goods, the manufacturing cost, the marketplace, competition, market condition, brand, and quality of product.Pricing is a fundamental aspect of product management and is one of the four Ps of the marketing mix, the other three aspects being product, promotion, and place. Price is the only revenue generating element amongst the four Ps, the rest being cost centers. However, the other Ps of marketing will contribute to decreasing price elasticity and so enable price increases to drive greater revenue and profits.Pricing can be a manual or automatic process of applying prices to purchase and sales orders, based on factors such as: a fixed amount, quantity break, promotion or sales campaign, specific vendor quote, price prevailing on entry, shipment or invoice date, combination of multiple orders or lines, and many others.

In common communication, it is a farewell (sometimes lengthened to \"good night\"), mainly when someone is going to sleep or leaving.Astronomical night is the period between astronomical dusk and astronomical dawn when the Sun is between 18 and 90 degrees below the horizon and does not illuminate the sky. As seen from latitudes between about 48.56\u00b0 and 65.73\u00b0 north or south of the equator, complete darkness does not occur around the summer solstice because, although the Sun sets, it is never more than 18\u00b0 below the horizon at lower culmination, \u221290\u00b0 Sun angles occur at the Tropic of Cancer on the December solstice and Tropic of Capricorn on the June solstice, and at the equator on equinoxes.

A duty may arise from a system of ethics or morality, especially in an honor culture. Many duties are created by law, sometimes including a codified punishment or liability for non-performance. Performing one's duty may require some sacrifice of self-interest.\nCicero, an early Roman philosopher who discusses duty in his work \u201cOn Duty\", suggests that duties can come from four different sources:\nas a result of being a human\nas a result of one's particular place in life (one's family, one's country, one's job)\nas a result of one's character\nas a result of one's own moral expectations for oneselfThe specific duties imposed by law or culture vary considerably, depending on jurisdiction, religion, and social normalities.\n\n", "The career is an individual's metaphorical \"journey\" through learning, work and other aspects of life.

A pension may be a \"defined benefit plan\", where a fixed sum is paid regularly to a person, or a \"defined contribution plan\", under which a fixed sum is invested that then becomes available at retirement age. Pensions should not be confused with severance pay; the former is usually paid in regular amounts for life after retirement, while the latter is typically paid as a fixed amount after involuntary termination of employment before retirement.\nThe terms \"retirement plan\" and \"superannuation\" tend to refer to a pension granted upon retirement of the individual. Retirement plans may be set up by employers, insurance companies, the government, or other institutions such as employer associations or trade unions. Called retirement plans in the United States, they are commonly known as pension schemes in the United Kingdom and Ireland and superannuation plans (or super) in Australia and New Zealand. Retirement pensions are typically in the form of a guaranteed life annuity, thus insuring against the risk of longevity.\nA pension created by an employer for the benefit of an employee is commonly referred to as an occupational or employer pension. Labor unions, the government, or other organizations may also fund pensions. Occupational pensions are a form of deferred compensation, usually advantageous to employee and employer for tax reasons. Many pensions also contain an additional insurance aspect, since they often will pay benefits to survivors or disabled beneficiaries. Other vehicles (certain lottery payouts, for example, or an annuity) may provide a similar stream of payments.\nThe common use of the term pension is to describe the payments a person receives upon retirement, usually under pre-determined legal or contractual terms. A recipient of a retirement pension is known as a pensioner or retiree.", "A plan is typically any diagram or list of steps with details of timing and resources, used to achieve an objective to do something.

In most cases, the absence of a well-laid plan can have adverse effects: for example, a non-robust project plan can cost the organization time and money.\nInformal or ad hoc plans are created by individuals in all of their pursuits.The most popular ways to describe plans are by their breadth, time frame, and specificity; however, these planning classifications are not independent of one another. For instance, there is a close relationship between the short- and long-term categories and the strategic and operational categories.\nIt is common for less formal plans to be created as abstract ideas, and remain in that form as they are maintained and put to use. More formal plans as used for business and military purposes, while initially created with and as an abstract thought, are likely to be written down, drawn up or otherwise stored in a form that is accessible to multiple people across time and space. This allows more reliable collaboration in the execution of the plan.", "The police are a constituted body of persons empowered by a state, with the aim to enforce the law, to ensure the safety, health, and possessions of citizens, and to prevent crime and civil disorder. Their lawful powers include arrest and the use of force legitimized by the state via the monopoly on violence. The term is most commonly associated with the police forces of a sovereign state that are authorized to exercise the police power of that state within a defined legal or territorial area of responsibility. Police forces are often defined as being separate from the military and other organizations involved in the defense of the state against foreign aggressors; however, gendarmerie are military units charged with civil policing.

The first known taxation took place in Ancient Egypt around 3000\u20132800 BC. A failure to pay in a timely manner (non-compliance), along with evasion of or resistance to taxation, is punishable by law. Taxes consist of direct or indirect taxes and may be paid in money or as its labor equivalent.\nMost countries have a tax system in place, in order to pay for public, common societal, or agreed national needs and for the functions of government. Some levy a flat percentage rate of taxation on personal annual income, but most scale taxes are progressive based on brackets of annual income amounts. Most countries charge a tax on an individual's income as well as on corporate income. Countries or subunits often also impose wealth taxes, inheritance taxes, estate taxes, gift taxes, property taxes, sales taxes, use taxes, payroll taxes, duties and/or tariffs.\nIn economic terms, taxation transfers wealth from households or businesses to the government. This has effects on economic growth and economic welfare that can be both increased (known as fiscal multiplier) or decreased (known as excess burden of taxation). Consequently, taxation is a highly debated topic by some, although taxation is deemed necessary by general consensus in order for society to function and grow in an orderly and equitable manner, others such as libertarians and anarcho-capitalists denounce taxation broadly or in its entirety, classifying it as theft or extortion through coercion and the use of force.", "Absenteeism is a habitual pattern of absence from a duty or obligation without good reason.

Prisons are most commonly used within a criminal justice system: people charged with crimes may be imprisoned until their trial; those pleading or being found guilty of crimes at trial may be sentenced to a specified period of imprisonment. In simplest terms, a prison can also be described as a building in which people are legally held as a punishment for a crime they have committed.Prisons can also be used as a tool of political repression by authoritarian regimes. Their perceived opponents may be imprisoned for political crimes, often without trial or other legal due process; this use is illegal under most forms of international law governing fair administration of justice. In times of war, prisoners of war or detainees may be detained in military prisons or prisoner of war camps, and large groups of civilians might be imprisoned in internment camps.In American English, the terms prison and jail have separate definitions, though this is not always strictly adhered to in casual speech.

The best-known type of hospital is the general hospital, which typically has an emergency department to treat urgent health problems ranging from fire and accident victims to a sudden illness. A district hospital typically is the major health care facility in its region, with many beds for intensive care and additional beds for patients who need long-term care. Specialized hospitals include trauma centers, rehabilitation hospitals, children's hospitals, seniors' (geriatric) hospitals, and hospitals for dealing with specific medical needs such as psychiatric treatment (see psychiatric hospital) and certain disease categories. Specialized hospitals can help reduce health care costs compared to general hospitals. Hospitals are classified as general, specialty, or government depending on the sources of income received.A teaching hospital combines assistance to people with teaching to health science students  and auxiliary healthcare students. A health science  facility smaller than a hospital is generally called a clinic. Hospitals have a range of departments (e.g. surgery and urgent care) and specialist units such as cardiology. Some hospitals have outpatient departments and some have chronic treatment units. Common support units include a pharmacy, pathology, and radiology.Hospitals are typically funded by public funding, health organisations (for-profit or nonprofit), health insurance companies, or charities, including direct charitable donations.

A variety of definitions have been used for different purposes over time. Health can be promoted by encouraging healthful activities, such as regular physical exercise and adequate sleep, and by reducing or avoiding unhealthful activities or situations, such as smoking or excessive stress. Some factors affecting health are due to individual choices, such as whether to engage in a high-risk behavior, while others are due to structural causes, such as whether the society is arranged in a way that makes it easier or harder for people to get necessary healthcare services. Still, other factors are beyond both individual and group choices, such as genetic disorders.", "In many countries, a mayor is the highest-ranking official in a municipal government such as that of a city or a town.

A skirt suit is similar, but with a matching skirt instead of trousers. It is considered informal wear in Western dress codes. The lounge suit originated in 19th-century Britain as a more casual alternative for sportswear and British country clothing, with roots in early modern Western Europe. After replacing the black frock coat in the early 20th century as regular daywear, a sober one-colored suit became known as a lounge suit.Suits are offered in different designs and constructions. Cut and cloth, whether two- or three-piece, single- or double-breasted, vary, in addition to various accessories. A two-piece suit has a jacket and trousers; a three-piece suit adds a waistcoat. Hats were almost always worn outdoors (and sometimes indoors) with all men's clothes until the counterculture of the 1960s in Western culture.

Just like the shell of a mollusk, a pearl is composed of calcium carbonate (mainly aragonite or a mixture of aragonite and calcite) in minute crystalline form, which has deposited in concentric layers. The ideal pearl is perfectly round and smooth, but many other shapes, known as baroque pearls, can occur. The finest quality of natural pearls have been highly valued as gemstones and objects of beauty for many centuries. Because of this, pearl has become a metaphor for something rare, fine, admirable and valuable.The most valuable pearls occur spontaneously in the wild, but are extremely rare. These wild pearls are referred to as natural pearls. Cultured or farmed pearls from pearl oysters and freshwater mussels make up the majority of those currently sold. Imitation pearls are also widely sold in inexpensive jewelry. Pearls have been harvested and cultivated primarily for use in jewelry, but in the past were also used to adorn clothing. They have also been crushed and used in cosmetics, medicines and paint formulations.Whether wild or cultured, gem-quality pearls are almost always nacreous and iridescent, like the interior of the shell that produces them. However, almost all species of shelled mollusks are capable of producing pearls (technically \"calcareous concretions\") of lesser shine or less spherical shape.

In Britain, soft fruit is a horticultural term for such fruits.In common usage, the term \"berry\" differs from the scientific or botanical definition of a fruit produced from the ovary of a single flower in which the outer layer of the ovary wall develops into an edible fleshy portion (pericarp). The botanical definition includes many fruits that are not commonly known or referred to as berries, such as grapes, tomatoes, cucumbers, eggplants, bananas, and chili peppers. Fruits commonly considered berries but excluded by the botanical definition include strawberries, raspberries, and blackberries, which are aggregate fruits and mulberries, which are multiple fruits.

The word daughter also has several other connotations attached to it, one of these being used in reference to a female descendant or consanguinity. It can also be used as a term of endearment coming from an elder.\nIn patriarchal societies, daughters often have different or lesser familial rights than sons. A family may prefer to have sons rather than daughters and subject daughters to female infanticide.

Under the \"American rule\", attorney fees are usually not paid by the losing party to the winning party in a case, except pursuant to specific statutory or.", "Birth is the act or process of bearing or bringing forth offspring, also referred to in technical contexts as parturition. In mammals, the process is initiated by hormones which cause the muscular walls of the uterus to contract, expelling the fetus at a developmental stage when it is ready to feed and breathe.\nIn some species the offspring is precocial and can move around almost immediately after birth but in others it is altricial and completely dependent on parenting.\nIn marsupials, the fetus is born at a very immature stage after a short gestation and develops further in its mother's womb  pouch.\nIt is not only mammals that give birth. Some reptiles, amphibians, fish and invertebrates carry their developing young inside them. Some of these are ovoviviparous, with the eggs being hatched inside the mother's body, and others are viviparous, with the embryo developing inside her body, as in the case of mammals.\n\n", "A man is an adult human who has primary and/or secondary male sex characteristics. Prior to adulthood, a male human is referred to as a boy (a male child or adolescent). Like most other male mammals, a man's genome usually inherits an X chromosome from the mother and a Y chromosome from the father. Sex differentiation of the male fetus is governed by the SRY gene on the Y chromosome. During puberty, hormones which stimulate androgen production result in the development of secondary sexual characteristics, thus exhibiting greater differences between the sexes. These include greater muscle mass, the growth of facial hair and a lower body fat composition.Male anatomy is distinguished from female anatomy by the male reproductive system, which includes the penis, testicles, sperm duct, prostate gland and the epididymis, and by secondary sex characteristics, including a narrower pelvis, narrower hips, and smaller breasts without mammary glands.Throughout human history, traditional gender roles have often defined and limited men's activities and opportunities. Men often face  conscription into military service or are directed into professions with high mortality rates, resulting in a shorter life expectancy than women. Many religious doctrines stipulate certain rules for men, such as forced circumcision. Men are over-represented as both perpetrators and victims of violence.Trans men have a gender identity that does not align with their female sex assignment at birth, while intersex men may.", "A year is the orbital period of a planetary body, for example, the Earth, moving in its orbit around the Sun. Due to the Earth's axial tilt, the course of a year sees the passing of the seasons, marked by change in weather, the hours of daylight, and, consequently, vegetation and soil fertility. In temperate and subpolar regions around the planet, four seasons are generally recognized: spring, summer, autumn and winter. In tropical and subtropical regions, several geographical sectors do not present defined seasons; but in the seasonal tropics, the annual wet and dry seasons are recognized and tracked.\nA calendar year is an approximation of the number of days of the Earth's orbital period, as counted in a given calendar. The Gregorian calendar, or modern calendar, presents its calendar year to be either a common year of 365 days or a leap year of 366 days, as do the Julian calendars. For the Gregorian calendar, the average length of the calendar year (the mean year) across the complete leap cycle of 400 years is 365.2425 days (97 out of 400 years are leap years). \nIn English, the unit of time for year is commonly abbreviated as \"y\" or \"yr\". The symbol \"a\" is more common in scientific literature, though its exact duration may be inconsistent.\nIn astronomy, the Julian year is a unit of time defined as 365.25 days of exactly 86,400 seconds (SI base unit), totalling exactly 31,557,600 seconds in the Julian astronomical year.The word year is also used for periods loosely associated with, but not identical to, the calendar or astronomical year, such as the seasonal year, the fiscal year, the academic year, etc. Similarly, year can mean the orbital period of any planet; for example, a Martian year and a Venusian year are examples of the time a planet takes to transit one complete orbit. The term can also be used in reference to any long period or cycle, such as the Great Year.", "A home, or domicile, is a space used as a permanent or semi-permanent residence for one or many humans, and sometimes various companion animals.

Commander Gene Cernan and Lunar Module Pilot Harrison Schmitt walked on the Moon, while Command Module Pilot Ronald Evans orbited above. Schmitt was the only professional geologist to land on the Moon; he was selected in place of Joe Engle, as NASA had been under pressure to send a scientist to the Moon. The mission's heavy emphasis on science meant the inclusion of a number of new experiments, including a biological experiment containing five mice that was carried in the command module.Mission planners had two primary goals in deciding on the landing site: to sample lunar highland material older than that at Mare Imbrium and to investigate the possibility of relatively recent volcanic activity. They therefore selected Taurus\u2013Littrow, where formations that had been viewed and pictured from orbit were thought to be volcanic in nature. Since all three crew members had backed up previous Apollo lunar missions, they were familiar with the Apollo spacecraft and had had more time for geology training.Launched at 12:33 a.m. Eastern Standard Time (EST) on December 7, 1972, following the only launch-pad delay in the course of the whole Apollo program that was caused by a hardware problem, Apollo 17 was a \"J-type\" mission that.", "The Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) is an assessment of executive function behaviors at home and at school for children and adolescents ages 5\u201318.

It lies between violet and cyan on the spectrum of visible light. The eye perceives blue when observing light with a dominant wavelength between approximately 450 and 495 nanometres. Most blues contain a slight mixture of other colours; azure contains some green, while ultramarine contains some violet. The clear daytime sky and the deep sea appear blue because of an optical effect known as Rayleigh scattering. An optical effect called Tyndall effect explains blue eyes. Distant objects appear more blue because of another optical effect called aerial perspective.Blue has been an important colour in art and decoration since ancient times. The semi-precious stone lapis lazuli was used in ancient Egypt for jewellery and ornament and later, in the Renaissance, to make the pigment ultramarine, the most expensive of all pigments. In the eighth century Chinese artists used cobalt blue to colour fine blue and white porcelain. In the Middle Ages, European artists used it in the windows of cathedrals. Europeans wore clothing coloured with the vegetable dye woad until it was replaced by the finer indigo from America. In the 19th century, synthetic blue dyes and pigments gradually replaced organic dyes and mineral pigments. Dark blue became a common colour for military uniforms and later, in the late 20th century, for business suits..", "A ridge is a long, narrow, elevated geomorphologic landform, structural feature, or combination of both separated from the surrounding terrain by steep sides. The sides of a ridge slope away from a narrow top, the crest or ridgecrest, with the terrain dropping down on either side. The crest, if narrow, is also called a ridgeline. Limitations on the dimensions of a ridge are lacking. Its height above the surrounding terrain can vary from less than a meter to hundreds of meters. A ridge can be either depositional, erosional, tectonic, or combination of these in origin and can consist of either bedrock, loose sediment, lava, or ice depending on its origin. A ridge can occur as either an isolated, independent feature or part of a larger geomorphological and/or structural feature.

Audience members participate in different ways in different kinds of art. Some events invite overt audience participation and others allow only modest clapping and criticism and reception.\nMedia audience studies have become a recognized part of the curriculum. Audience theory offers scholarly insight into audiences in general. These insights shape our knowledge of just how audiences affect and are affected by different forms of art.

The character may be entirely fictional or based on a real-life person, in which case the distinction of a \"fictional\" versus \"real\" character may be made. Derived from the Ancient Greek word \u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1, the English word dates from the Restoration, although it became widely used after its appearance in Tom Jones by Henry Fielding in 1749. From this, the sense of \"a part played by an actor\" developed. (Before this development, the term dramatis personae, naturalized in English from Latin and meaning \"masks of the drama,\" encapsulated the notion of characters from the literal aspect of masks.) Character, particularly when enacted by an actor in the theatre or cinema, involves \"the illusion of being a human person\". In literature, characters guide readers through their stories, helping them to understand plots and ponder themes. Since the end of the 18th century, the phrase \"in character\" has been used to describe an effective impersonation by an actor. Since the 19th century, the art of creating characters, as practiced by actors or writers, has been called characterisation.A character who stands as a representative of a particular class or group of people is known as a type. Types include both stock characters and those that are more fully individualised. The characters in Henrik Ibsen's Hedda Gablercode: nor promoted to code: no  (1891) and August Strindberg's Miss Julie (1888), for example, are representative of specific positions in the social relations of class and gender, such that the conflicts between the characters reveal ideological conflicts.The study of a character requires an analysis of its relations with all of the other characters in the work.

The term is derived from the Old French comt\u00e9  denoting a jurisdiction under the sovereignty of a count (earl) or a viscount. Literal equivalents in other languages, derived from the equivalent of \"count\", are now seldom used officially, including comt\u00e9, contea, contado, comtat, condado, Grafschaft, graafschap, and zhupa in Slavic languages; terms equivalent to commune/community are now often instead used.When the Normans conquered England, they brought the term with them. The Saxons had already established the districts that became the historic counties of England, calling them shires; many county names derive from the name of the county town (county seat) with the word shire added on: for example, Gloucestershire and Worcestershire. The Anglo-Saxon terms earl and earldom were taken as equivalent to the continental terms \"count\" and \"county\" under the conquering Normans, and over time the two blended and became equivalent. Further, the later-imported term became a synonym for the native Old English word s\u010b\u012br ([\u0283i\u02d0r]) or, in Modern English, shire \u2013 an equivalent administrative division of the kingdom. The term \"county\" evolved, consequently, to designate a level of local administration that was immediately beneath a national government, within a unitary (non-federal) system of government. County later also became used differently in some federal systems of government, for a local administrative division subordinate to a primary subnational entity, such as a Province (e.g. Canada) or a level 3 territorial unit.", "A ballot is a device used to cast votes in an election and may be found as a piece of paper or a small ball used in secret voting.

An IMC is a platform in which a group of people can group their ideas, beliefs, and concepts into one large media base. Advertising campaigns utilize diverse media channels over a particular time frame and target identified audiences.The campaign theme is the central message that will be received in the promotional activities and is the prime focus of the advertising campaign, as it sets the motif for the series of individual advertisements and other marketing communications that will be used. The campaign themes are usually produced with the objective of being used for a significant period but many of them are temporal due to factors like being not effective or market conditions, competition and marketing mix.Advertising campaigns are built to accomplish a particular objective or a set of objectives. Such objectives usually include establishing a brand, raising brand awareness, aggrandizing the rate of conversions/sales..", "Resignation  is the formal act of leaving or quitting one's office or position. A resignation can occur when a person holding a position gained by election or appointment steps down, but leaving a position upon the expiration of a term, or choosing not to seek an additional term, is not considered resignation.\nWhen an employee chooses to leave a position, it is considered a resignation, as opposed to involuntary termination.  Whether an employee resigned or was terminated is sometimes a topic of dispute, because in many situations, a terminated employee is eligible for severance pay and/or unemployment benefits, whereas one who voluntarily resigns may not be eligible. Abdication is the equivalent of resignation for a reigning monarch, pope, or holder of another similar position.\n\n", "Time is the continued sequence of existence and events that occurs in an apparently irreversible succession from the past, through the present, into the future. It is a component quantity of various measurements used to sequence events, to compare the duration of events or the intervals between them, and to quantify rates of change of quantities in material reality or in the conscious experience. Time is often referred to as a fourth dimension, along with three spatial dimensions.Time has long been an important subject of study in religion, philosophy, and science, but defining it in a manner applicable to all fields without circularity has consistently eluded scholars.Nevertheless, diverse fields such as business, industry, sports, the sciences, and the performing arts all incorporate some notion of time into their respective measuring systems.Time in physics is operationally defined as \"what a clock reads\".The physical nature of time is addressed by general relativity with respect to events in spacetime. Examples of events are the collision of two particles, the explosion of a supernova, or the arrival of a rocket ship. Every event can be assigned four numbers representing its time and position (the event's coordinates). However, the numerical values are different for different observers. In general relativity, the question of what time it is now only has meaning relative to a particular observer. Distance and time are intimately related, and the time required for light to travel a specific distance is the same for all observers, as first publicly demonstrated by Michelson and Morley. General relativity does not address the nature of time for extremely small intervals where quantum mechanics holds. As of 2023, there is no generally accepted theory of quantum general relativity.Time is one of the seven fundamental physical quantities in both the International System of Units (SI) and International System of Quantities.

In some areas of the United States, it is used as an equivalent term to controlled-access highway, or a translation for autobahn, autoroute, etc.According to Merriam Webster, the use of the term predates the 12th century. According to Etymonline, \"high\" is in the sense of \"main\".\nIn North American and Australian English, major roads such as controlled-access highways or arterial roads are often state highways (Canada: provincial highways). Other roads may be designated \"county highways\" in the US and Ontario. These classifications refer to the level of government (state, provincial, county) that maintains the roadway. In British English, \"highway\" is primarily a legal term. Everyday use normally implies roads, while the legal use covers any route or path with a public right of access, including footpaths etc.\nThe term has led to several related derived terms, including highway system, highway code, highway patrol and highwayman.", "BOND (Building Object Network Databases) started development in late 2000 as a rapid application development tool for the GNOME Desktop by Treshna Enterprises.

The name comes from the ancient Roman Senate (Latin: Senatus), so-called as an assembly of the senior (Latin: senex meaning \"the elder\" or \"old man\") and therefore considered wiser and more experienced members of the society or ruling class. However the Roman Senate was not the ancestor or predecessor of modern parliamentarism in any sense, because the Roman senate was not a legislative body.Many countries have an assembly named a senate, composed of senators who may be elected, appointed, have inherited the title, or gained membership by other methods, depending on the country. Modern senates typically serve to provide a chamber of \"sober second thought\" to consider legislation passed by a lower house, whose members are usually elected. Most senates have asymmetrical duties and powers compared with their respective lower house meaning they have special duties, for example to fill important political positions or to pass special laws. Conversely many senates have limited powers in changing or stopping bills under consideration and efforts to stall or veto a bill may be bypassed by the lower house or another branch of government.", "Clinical trials are prospective biomedical or behavioral research studies on human participants designed to answer specific questions about biomedical or behavioral interventions, including new treatments (such as novel vaccines, drugs, dietary choices, dietary supplements, and medical devices) and known interventions that warrant further study and comparison.

The delivery of a service for a cost is also considered a sale.\nThe seller, or the provider of the goods or services, completes a sale in response to an acquisition, appropriation, requisition, or a direct interaction with the buyer at the point of sale. There is a passing of title (property or ownership) of the item, and the settlement of a price, in which agreement is reached on a price for which transfer of ownership of the item will occur. The seller, not the purchaser, typically executes the sale and it may be completed prior to the obligation of payment.

The first known taxation took place in Ancient Egypt around 3000\u20132800 BC. A failure to pay in a timely manner (non-compliance), along with evasion of or resistance to taxation, is punishable by law. Taxes consist of direct or indirect taxes and may be paid in money or as its labor equivalent.\nMost countries have a tax system in place, in order to pay for public, common societal, or agreed national needs and for the functions of government. Some levy a flat percentage rate of taxation on personal annual income, but most scale taxes are progressive based on brackets of annual income amounts. Most countries charge a tax on an individual's income as well as on corporate income. Countries or subunits often also impose wealth taxes, inheritance taxes, estate taxes, gift taxes, property taxes, sales taxes, use taxes, payroll taxes, duties and/or tariffs.\nIn economic terms, taxation transfers wealth from households or businesses to the government. This has effects on economic growth and economic welfare that can be both increased (known as fiscal multiplier) or decreased (known as excess burden of taxation). Consequently, taxation is a highly debated topic by some, although taxation is deemed necessary by general consensus in order for society to function and grow in an orderly and equitable manner, others such as libertarians and anarcho-capitalists denounce taxation broadly or in its entirety, classifying it as theft or extortion through coercion and the use of force.", "A  battle  is an occurrence of combat in warfare between opposing military units of any number or size.

The Constitution of the United Kingdom is a notable example of an uncodified constitution; it is instead written in numerous fundamental Acts of a legislature, court cases, or treaties.Constitutions concern different levels of organizations, from sovereign countries to companies and unincorporated associations. A treaty that establishes an international organization is also its constitution, in that it would define how that organization is constituted. Within states, a constitution defines the principles upon which the state is based, the procedure in which laws are made and by whom.

It is used in optics applied to light waves, in antenna theory applied to radio waves, and in acoustics applied to sound waves.  The colloquial use of the term \"resolution\" sometimes causes confusion; when an optical system is said to have a high resolution or high angular resolution, it means that the perceived distance, or actual angular distance, between resolved neighboring objects is small. The value that quantifies this property, \u03b8, which is given by the Rayleigh criterion, is low for a system with a high resolution. The closely related term spatial resolution refers to the precision of a measurement with respect to space, which is directly connected to angular resolution in imaging instruments.

On average, this is 24 hours, 1440 minutes, or 86,400 seconds. In everyday life, the word \"day\" often refers to a solar day, which is the length between two solar noons or times the Sun reaches the highest point. The word \"day\" may also refer to daytime, a time period when the location receives direct and indirect sunlight. On Earth, as a location passes through its day, it experiences morning, noon, afternoon, evening, and night. The effect of a day is vital to many life processes, which is called the circadian rhythm.A collection of sequential days is organized into calendars as dates, almost always into weeks, months and years. Most calendars' arrangement of dates use either or both the Sun with its four seasons (solar calendar) or the Moon's phasing (lunar calendar).  The start of a day is commonly accepted as roughly the time of the middle of the night or midnight, written as 00:00 or 12:00 am in 24- or 12-hour clocks, respectively. Because the time of midnight varies between locations, time zones are set up to facilitate the use of a uniform standard time.  Midnight is not the only convention used to determine the start of a new day.  Other defining moments have been used throughout history, and some are used even today, such as with the Jewish religious calendar, which counts days from sunset to sunset, so the Jewish Sabbath begins at sundown on Friday.  Astronomers also have a convention where their day begins at high noon.  This way, all of their observations throughout a single night are recorded as happening on the same day.  This method removes ambiguity of a particular observation happening on a calendar day, eliminating the need to further determine which night it happened on.  Because when using midnight as the start of day, each calendar day is associated with two separate night periods.In specific applications, the.", "Sunday is the day of the week between Saturday and Monday.

Neither executive privilege nor the oversight power of Congress is explicitly mentioned in the United States Constitution.  However, the Supreme Court of the United States has ruled that executive privilege and congressional oversight each are a consequence of the doctrine of the separation of powers, derived from the supremacy of each branch in its area of constitutional activity.The Supreme Court confirmed the legitimacy of this doctrine in United States v. Nixon in the context of a subpoena emanating from the judiciary instead of emanating from Congress. The Court held that there is a qualified privilege, which once invoked, creates a presumption of privilege, and the party seeking the documents must then make a \"sufficient showing\" that the \"presidential material\" is \"essential to the justice of the case\".

In Ancient Rome, Ludi Plebeii was held from November 4\u201317, Epulum Jovis was held on November 13 and Brumalia celebrations began on November 24. These dates do not correspond to the modern Gregorian calendar.\nNovember was referred to as Bl\u014dtm\u014dna\u00fe by the Anglo-Saxons. Brumaire and Frimaire were the months on which November fell in the French Republican calendar. \n\n", "An amendment is a formal or official change made to a law, contract, constitution, or other legal document.  It is based on the verb to amend, which means to change for better.  Amendments can add, remove, or update parts of these agreements.

The book originated as lecture notes that Jackson prepared for teaching graduate-level electromagnetism first at McGill University and then at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Intended for graduate students, and often known as Jackson for short, it has been a standard reference on its subject since its first publication in 1962.The book is notorious for the difficulty of its problems, and its tendency to treat non-obvious conclusions as self-evident.

Countries may provide aid for further diplomatic reasons. Humanitarian and altruistic purposes are often reasons for foreign assistance.Aid may be given by individuals, private organizations, or governments. Standards delimiting exactly the types of transfers considered \"aid\" vary from country to country. For example, the United States government discontinued the reporting of military aid as part of its foreign aid figures in 1958. The most widely used measure of aid is \"Official Development Assistance\" (ODA).", "Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims, such as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character traits.

More specifically, commerce is not business, but rather the part of business which facilitates the movement and distribution of finished or unfinished but valuable goods and services from the producers to the end consumers on a large scale, as opposed to the sourcing of raw materials and manufacturing of those goods. Commerce is subtly different from trade as well, which is the final transaction, exchange or transfer of finished goods and services between a seller and an end consumer.

It is the process of distributing and entrusting work to another person, and therefore one of the core concepts of management leadership. The process involves managers deciding which work they should do themselves and which work should be delegated to others for completion. From a managerial standpoint, delegation involves shifting project responsibility to team members, giving them the opportunity to finalize the work product effectively, with minimal intervention. The opposite of effective delegation is micromanagement, where a manager provides too much input, direction, and review of delegated work. Delegation empowers a subordinate to make decisions. It is a shifting of decision-making authority as well as responsibility for the results from one organisational level to another lower one. However, a certain level of accountability for the outcome of the work does remain with the person who delegated the work to begin with.There are a number of reasons someone may decide to delegate. These include: To free themselves up to do other tasks in the pace of their ownTo have the most qualified person making the decisionsTo seek another qualified person's perspective on an issueTo develop someone else's ability to handle the additional assignments.", "Washington most commonly refers to:\n\nWashington (state), United States\nWashington, D.C., the capital of the United States\nA metonym for the federal government of the United States\nWashington metropolitan area, the metropolitan area centered on Washington, D.C.\nGeorge Washington (1732\u20131799), the first president of the United StatesWashington may also refer to:", "A Bug's Life is a 1998 American computer-animated comedy film produced by Pixar Animation Studios for Walt Disney Pictures. It was the second feature-length film produced by Pixar. Directed by John Lasseter and co-directed by Andrew Stanton, the film involves a misfit ant, Flik, who is looking for \"tough warriors\" to save his colony from a protection racket run by a gang of grasshoppers. Unfortunately, the \"warriors\" he brings back turn out to be an inept troupe of Circus Bugs.\nThe film was initially inspired by Aesop's fable The Ant and the Grasshopper. Production began shortly after the release of Toy Story in 1995. The screenplay was penned by Stanton and comedy writers Donald McEnery and Bob Shaw from a story by Lasseter, Stanton, and Joe Ranft. The ants in the film were redesigned to be more appealing, and Pixar's animation unit employed technical innovations in computer animation. Randy Newman composed the music for the film. During production, a controversial public feud erupted between Steve Jobs and Lasseter of Pixar and DreamWorks co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg due to the parallel production of his similar film Antz, which was released the same year.\nThe film was released on November 20, 1998, received positive reviews and grossed $363 million at the box office.

The term accident implies that nobody should be blamed, but the event may have been caused by unrecognized or unaddressed risks.  Most researchers who study unintentional injury avoid using the term accident and focus on factors that increase risk of severe injury and that reduce injury incidence and severity.

Education originated as the transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals increasingly encompass new ideas such as the liberation of learners, skills needed for modern society, empathy, and complex vocational skills.\nTypes of education are commonly divided into formal, non-formal, and informal education. Formal education takes place in education and training institutions, is usually structured by curricular aims and objectives, and learning is typically guided by a teacher. In most regions, formal education is compulsory up to a certain age and commonly divided into educational stages such as kindergarten, primary school and secondary school. Nonformal education occurs as addition or alternative to formal education. It may be structured according to educational arrangements, but in a more flexible manner, and usually takes place in community-based, workplace-based or civil society-based settings. Lastly, informal education occurs in daily life, in the family, any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational, whether unintentional or intentional. In practice there is a continuum from the highly formalized to the highly informalized, and informal learning can occur in all three settings. For instance, homeschooling can be classified as nonformal or informal, depending upon the structure.\nRegardless of setting, educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion, and directed research. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy. Education is supported by a variety of different philosophies, theories and empirical research agendas.\nThere are movements for education reforms, such as for improving quality and efficiency of education towards relevance in students' lives and efficient problem solving in modern or future society at large, or for evidence-based education methodologies. A right to education has been recognized by some governments and the United Nations. For example, 24 January is the International Day of Education.

In colloquial usage, the word \"pistol\" is often used to describe any type of handgun, inclusive of revolvers (which have a single barrel and a separate cylinder housing multiple chambers) and the pocket-sized derringers (which are often multi-barrelled).\nThe most common type of pistol used in the contemporary era is the semi-automatic pistol, while the older single-shot and manual repeating pistols are now rarely seen and used primarily for nostalgic hunting and historical reenactment, and the fully automatic machine pistols are uncommon in civilian usage due to generally poor recoil-controllability and strict laws and regulations governing their manufacture and sale.", "Alphabetical order is a system whereby character strings are placed in order based on the position of the characters in the conventional ordering of an alphabet. It is one of the methods of collation. In mathematics, a lexicographical order is the generalization of the alphabetical order to other data types, such as sequences of numbers or other ordered mathematical objects.\nWhen applied to strings or sequences that may contain digits, numbers or more elaborate types of elements, in addition to alphabetical characters, the alphabetical order is generally called a lexicographical order.\nTo determine which of two strings of characters comes first when arranging in alphabetical order, their first letters are compared. If they differ, then the string whose first letter comes earlier in the alphabet comes before the other string. If the first letters are the same, then the second letters are compared, and so on. If a position is reached where one string has no more letters to compare while the other does, then the first (shorter) string is deemed to come first in alphabetical order.\nCapital or upper case letters are generally considered to be identical to their corresponding lower case letters for the purposes of alphabetical ordering, although conventions may be adopted to handle situations where two strings differ only in capitalization. Various conventions also exist for the handling of strings containing spaces, modified letters, such as those with diacritics, and non-letter characters such as marks of punctuation.\nThe result of placing a set of words or strings in alphabetical order is that all of the strings beginning with the same letter are grouped together; within that grouping all words beginning with the same two-letter sequence are grouped together; and so on. The system thus tends to maximize the number of common initial letters between adjacent words.", "The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.

Other terms for liquor include: spirit, distilled beverage, spirituous liquor or hard liquor. The distillation process concentrates the liquid to increase its alcohol by volume. As liquors contain significantly more alcohol (ethanol) than other alcoholic drinks, they are considered 'harder'; in North America, the term hard liquor is sometimes used to distinguish distilled alcoholic drinks from non-distilled ones, whereas the term spirits is more common in the UK. Some examples of liquors include vodka, rum, gin, and tequila. Liquors are often aged in barrels, such as for the production of brandy and whiskey, or are infused with flavorings to form a flavored liquor such as absinthe.While the word liquor ordinarily refers to distilled alcoholic spirits rather than beverages produced by fermentation alone, it can sometimes be used more broadly to refer to any alcoholic beverage (or even non-alcoholic products of distillation or various other liquids).Like other alcoholic drinks, liquor is typically consumed for the psychoactive effects of alcohol. Liquor may be consumed on its own ('neat'), typically in amounts of around 50 millilitres (1.7 US fluid ounces) per served drink. In an undiluted form, distilled beverages are often slightly sweet, and bitter, and typically impart a burning mouthfeel, with an odor derived from the alcohol and the production and aging processes; the exact flavor varies between different varieties of liquor and the different impurities they impart. Liquor is also frequently mixed with other ingredients to form a cocktail.Rapid consumption of a large amount of liquor can cause severe.", "The bit is the most basic unit of information in computing and digital communications.

By clock time, midnight is the opposite of noon, differing from it by 12 hours.\nSolar midnight is the time opposite to solar noon, when the Sun is closest to the nadir, and the night is equidistant from dusk and dawn. Due to the advent of time zones, which regularize time across a range of meridians, and daylight saving time, solar midnight rarely coincides with 12 midnight on the clock. Solar midnight depends on longitude and time of the year rather than on time zone.  In ancient Roman timekeeping, midnight was halfway between sunset and sunrise (i.e., solar midnight), varying according to the seasons.\nIn some Slavic languages, \"midnight\" has an additional geographic association with \"north\" (as \"noon\" does with \"south\").

However, global population grew by roughly 1.9 billion during those years, showing a dramatic reduction in violence per capita. Of the deaths in 2013, roughly 842,000 were attributed to self-harm (suicide), 405,000 to interpersonal violence, and 31,000 to collective violence (war) and legal intervention. For each single death due to violence, there are dozens of hospitalizations, hundreds of emergency department visits, and thousands of doctors' appointments. Furthermore, violence often has lifelong consequences for physical and mental health and social functioning and can slow economic and social development.\nIn 2013, of the estimated 405,000 deaths due to interpersonal violence globally, assault by firearm was the cause in 180,000 deaths, assault by sharp object was the cause in 114,000 deaths, and the remaining 110,000 deaths from other causes.Violence in many forms can be preventable. There is a strong relationship between levels of violence and modifiable factors in a country such as an concentrated (regional) poverty, income and gender inequality, the harmful use of alcohol, and the absence of safe, stable, and nurturing relationships between children and parents. Strategies addressing the underlying causes of violence can be relatively effective in preventing violence, although mental and physical health and individual responses, personalities, etc. have always been decisive factors in the formation of these behaviors.\n\n", "Arthur is an animated edutainment television series for children ages 4 to 8, developed by Kathy Waugh for PBS, and produced by WGBH.

A large-caliber gun is also called a cannon.The means of projectile propulsion vary according to designs, but are traditionally effected pneumatically by a high gas pressure contained within a barrel tube (gun barrel), produced either through the rapid exothermic combustion of propellants (as with firearms), or by mechanical compression (as with air guns). The high-pressure gas is introduced behind the projectile, pushing and accelerating it down the length of the tube, imparting sufficient launch velocity to sustain its further travel towards the target once the propelling gas ceases acting upon it after it exits the muzzle. Alternatively, new-concept linear motor weapons may employ an electromagnetic field to achieve acceleration, in which case the barrel may be substituted by guide rails (as in railguns) or wrapped with magnetic coils (as in coilguns).The first devices identified as guns or proto-guns appeared in China from around AD 1000. By the end of the 13th century, they had become \"true guns,\" metal barrel firearms.", "A sheriff is a government official, with varying duties, existing in some countries with  historical ties to England where the office originated.

In some situations, the price of production has a different name. If the product is a \"good\" in the commercial exchange, the payment for this product will likely be called its \"price\". However, if the product is \"service\", there will be other possible names for this product's name. For example, the graph on the bottom will show some situations  A good's price is influenced by production costs, supply of the desired item, and demand for the product. A price may be determined by a monopolist or may be imposed on the firm by market conditions.Price can be quoted to currency, quantities of goods or vouchers.In modern economies, prices are generally expressed in units of some form of currency. (More specifically, for raw materials they are expressed as currency per unit weight, e.g. euros per kilogram or Rands per KG.)Although prices could be quoted as quantities of other goods or services, this sort of barter exchange is rarely seen. Prices are sometimes quoted in terms of vouchers such as trading stamps and air miles.In some circumstances, cigarettes have been used as currency, for example in prisons, in times of hyperinflation, and in some places during World War II.

Modern-day criminal investigations commonly employ many modern scientific techniques known collectively as forensic science.\nCriminal investigation is an ancient science that may have roots as far back as c. 1700 BCE in the writings of the Code of Hammurabi. In the code, it is suggested that both the accuser and the accused had the right to present evidence they collected. In the modern era, criminal investigations are most often done by government police forces.

Lending activities can be directly performed by the bank or indirectly through capital markets.\nBecause banks play an important role in financial stability and the economy of a country, most jurisdictions exercise a high degree of regulation over banks. Most countries have institutionalized a system known as fractional reserve banking, under which banks hold liquid assets equal to only a portion of their current liabilities. In addition to other regulations intended to ensure liquidity, banks are generally subject to minimum capital requirements based on an international set of capital standards, the Basel Accords.\nBanking in its modern sense evolved in the fourteenth century in the prosperous cities of Renaissance Italy but in many ways functioned as a continuation of ideas and concepts of credit and lending that had their roots in the ancient world. In the history of banking, a number of banking dynasties \u2013  notably, the Medicis, the Fuggers, the Welsers, the Berenbergs, and the Rothschilds \u2013  have played a central role over many centuries.

A person or entity who buys insurance is known as a policyholder, while a person or entity covered under the policy is called an insured. The insurance transaction involves the policyholder assuming a guaranteed, known, and relatively small loss in the form of a payment to the insurer (a premium) in exchange for the insurer's promise to compensate the insured in the event of a covered loss. The loss may or may not be financial, but it must be reducible to financial terms.

In general, it is defined as a social domain that emphasize the practices, discourses, and material expressions associated with the production, use, and management of scarce resources. A given economy is a set of processes that involves its culture, values, education, technological evolution, history, social organization, political structure, legal systems, and natural resources as main factors. These factors give context, content, and set the conditions and parameters in which an economy functions. In other words, the economic domain is a social domain of interrelated human practices and transactions that does not stand alone.\nEconomic agents can be individuals, businesses, organizations, or governments. Economic transactions occur when two groups or parties agree to the value or price of the transacted good or service, commonly expressed in a certain currency. However, monetary transactions only account for a small part of the economic domain.\nEconomic activity is spurred by production which uses natural resources, labor and capital. It has changed over time due to technology, innovation (new products, services, processes, expanding markets, diversification of markets, niche markets, increases revenue functions) such as, that which produces intellectual property and changes in industrial relations (most notably child labor being replaced in some parts of the world with universal access to education).", "Atmospheric circulation is the large-scale movement of air and together with ocean circulation is the means by which thermal energy is redistributed on the surface of the Earth. The Earth's atmospheric circulation varies from year to year, but the large-scale structure of its circulation remains fairly constant. The smaller scale weather systems \u2013 mid-latitude depressions, or tropical convective cells \u2013 occur chaotically, and long-range weather predictions of those cannot be made beyond ten days in practice, or a month in theory (see chaos theory and the butterfly effect).\nThe Earth's weather is a consequence of its illumination by the Sun and the laws of thermodynamics. The atmospheric circulation can be viewed as a heat engine driven by the Sun's energy and whose energy sink, ultimately, is the blackness of space. The work produced by that engine causes the motion of the masses of air, and in that process it redistributes the energy absorbed by the Earth's surface near the tropics to the latitudes nearer the poles, and thence to space.\nThe large-scale atmospheric circulation \"cells\" shift polewards in warmer periods (for example, interglacials compared to glacials), but remain largely constant as they are, fundamentally, a property of the Earth's size, rotation rate, heating and atmospheric depth, all of which change little.

Arguments can be studied from three main perspectives: the logical, the dialectical and the rhetorical perspective.In logic, an argument is usually expressed not in natural language but in a symbolic formal language, and it can be defined as any group of propositions of which one is claimed to follow from the others through deductively valid inferences that preserve truth from the premises to the conclusion. This logical perspective on argument is relevant for scientific fields such as mathematics and computer science. Logic is the study of the forms of reasoning in arguments and the development of standards and criteria to evaluate arguments. Deductive arguments can be valid, and the valid ones can be sound: in a valid argument, premisses necessitate the conclusion, even if one or more of the premises is false and the conclusion is false; in a sound argument, true premises necessitate a true conclusion. Inductive arguments, by contrast, can have different degrees of logical strength: the stronger or more cogent the argument, the greater the probability that the conclusion is true, the weaker the argument, the lesser that probability.

Humans began domesticating horses around 4000 BCE, and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BCE. Horses in the subspecies caballus are domesticated, although some domesticated populations live in the wild as feral horses.

Fees usually allow for overhead, wages, costs, and markup. Traditionally, professionals in the United Kingdom (and previously the Republic of Ireland) receive a fee in contradistinction to a payment, salary, or wage, and often use guineas rather than pounds as units of account. Under the feudal system, a Knight's fee was what was given to a knight for his service, usually the usage of land. A contingent fee is an attorney's fee which is reduced or not charged at all if the court case is lost by the attorney.\nA service fee, service charge, or surcharge is a fee added to a customer's bill. The purpose of a service charge often depends on the nature of the product and corresponding service provided. Examples of why this fee is charged are: travel time expenses, truck rental fees, liability and workers' compensation insurance fees, and planning fees. UPS and FedEx have recently begun surcharges for fuel.\nRestaurants and banquet halls charging service charges in lieu of tips must distribute them to their wait staff in some US states (e.g., Massachusetts, New York, Montana), but in the state of Kentucky may keep them. A fee may be a flat fee or a variable one, or part of a two-part tariff. A membership fee is charged as part of a subscription business model.\n\n", "A license (or licence) is an official permission or permit to do, use, or own something (as well as the document of that permission or permit).A license is granted by a party (licensor) to another party (licensee) as an element of an agreement between those parties. In the case of a license issued by a government, the license is obtained by applying for it. In the case of a private party, it is by a specific agreement, usually in writing (such as a lease or other contract).  The simplest definition is \"A license is a promise not to sue,\" because a license usually either permits the licensed party to engage in an activity which is illegal, and subject to prosecution, without the license (e.g. fishing, driving an automobile, or operating a broadcast radio or television station), or it permits the licensed party to do something that would violate the rights of the licensing party (e.g. make copies of a copyrighted work), which, without the license, the licensed party could be sued, civilly, criminally, or both.In particular, a license may be issued by authorities, to allow an activity that would otherwise be forbidden. It may require paying a fee or proving a capability (or both). The requirement may also serve to keep the authorities informed on a type of activity, and to give them the opportunity to set conditions and limitations.A licensor may grant a.", "Gas is one of the four fundamental states of matter. The others are solid, liquid, and plasma.A pure gas may be made up of individual atoms (e.g. a noble gas like neon), elemental molecules made from one type of atom (e.g. oxygen), or compound molecules made from a variety of atoms (e.g. carbon dioxide). A gas mixture, such as air, contains a variety of pure gases. What distinguishes a gas from liquids and solids is the vast separation of the individual gas particles. This separation usually makes a colourless gas invisible to the human observer.\nThe gaseous state of matter occurs between the liquid and plasma states, the latter of which provides the upper temperature boundary for gases. Bounding the lower end of the temperature scale lie degenerative quantum gases which are gaining increasing attention.\nHigh-density atomic gases super-cooled to very low temperatures are classified by their statistical behavior as either Bose gases or Fermi gases.

Its usage has evolved significantly over time. The term was introduced initially as a measure of pleasure or happiness as part of the theory of utilitarianism by moral philosophers such as Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill. The term has been adapted and reapplied within neoclassical economics, which dominates modern economic theory, as a utility function that represents a single consumer's preference ordering over a choice set but is not comparable across consumers. This concept of utility is personal and based on choice rather than on pleasure received, and so is specified more rigorously than the original concept but makes it less useful (and controversial) for ethical decisions.", "An administrative domain is a service provider holding a security repository permitting to easily authenticate and authorize clients with credentials.

It stars Cillian Murphy as a bicycle courier who awakens from a coma to discover the accidental release of a highly contagious, aggression-inducing virus has caused the breakdown of society. Naomie Harris, Christopher Eccleston, Megan Burns, and Brendan Gleeson appear in supporting roles.\nGarland took inspiration from George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead film series and John Wyndham's 1951 novel The Day of the Triffids for the film's post-apocalyptic story. Filming took place in various locations in the United Kingdom in 2001. The crew filmed for brief periods during early mornings and temporarily closed streets to capture recognisable and typically busy areas when they were deserted. John Murphy composed an original soundtrack for the film, with other instrumental songs by Brian Eno, Godspeed You! Black Emperor and other artists also being featured.\n28 Days Later was released  on 1 November 2002 to critical acclaim and financial success. Grossing more than $82.7 million worldwide on its modest budget of $8 million, it became one of the most profitable horror films of 2002. Reviewers praised Boyle's direction, the cast's performances, Garland's screenplay, the atmosphere and soundtrack. Despite Boyle not considering it a zombie film, 28 Days Later is credited with reinvigorating the zombie genre of horror film and influencing a revival in the decade after its release, with its fast-running infected and character-driven drama. Since its release, it has been featured in several \"best-of\" film lists and maintained a following, particularly amid the COVID-19 pandemic in the 2020s.\nThe film was followed by 2007 sequel 28 Weeks Later, a 2007 graphic novel titled 28 Days Later: The Aftermath, which expands on the timeline of the outbreak, and a 2009 to 2011 comic book series titled 28 Days Later.", "Owen may  refer to:\n\nOrigin: The name Owen is of Irish and Welsh origin. \nIts meanings range from noble, youthful, and well-born. \n\nGender: Owen is historically the masculine form of the name.

Needs are distinguished from wants. In the case of a need, a deficiency causes a clear adverse outcome: a dysfunction or death. In other words, a need is something required for a safe, stable and healthy life (e.g. air, water, food, land, shelter) while a want is a desire, wish or aspiration. When needs or wants are backed by purchasing power, they have the potential to become economic demands. \nBasic needs such as air, water, food and protection from environmental dangers are necessary for an organism to live. In addition to basic needs, humans also have needs of a social or societal nature such as the human need to socialise or belong to a family unit or group. Needs can be objective and physical, such as the need for food, or psychical and subjective, such as the need for self-esteem.

The state will sometimes endeavor to increase justice by operating courts and enforcing their rulings.\nEarly theories of justice were set out by the Ancient Greek philosophers Plato in his work The Republic, and Aristotle in his Nicomachean Ethics. Advocates of divine command theory have said that justice issues from God. In the 17th century, philosophers such as John Locke said that justice derives from natural law. Social contract theory said that justice is derived from the mutual agreement of everyone. In the 19th century, utilitarian philosophers such as John Stuart Mill said that justice is based on the best outcomes for the greatest number of people.\nTheories of distributive justice study what is to be distributed, between whom they are to be distributed, and what is the proper distribution. Egalitarians have said that justice can only exist within the coordinates of equality. John Rawls used a social contract theory to say that justice, and especially distributive justice, is a form of fairness. Robert Nozick and others said that property rights, also within the realm of distributive justice and natural law, maximizes the overall wealth of an economic system. Theories of retributive justice say that wrongdoing should be punished to ensure justice. The closely related restorative justice (also sometimes called \"reparative justice\") is an approach to justice that focuses on the needs of victims and offenders.", "The Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme is a mid-size car produced by Oldsmobile between 1966 and 1997. It was positioned as a premium offering at the top of the Cutlass range. It began as a trim package, developed its own roofline, and rose during the mid-1970s to become not only the most popular Oldsmobile but the highest selling model in its class.\nIt was produced as a rear-wheel drive two-door hardtop, sedan, and station wagon into the 1980s, and a convertible through 1972.

Categorization is considered one of the most fundamental cognitive abilities, and as such it is studied particularly by psychology and cognitive linguistics.\nCategorization is sometimes considered synonymous with classification (cf., Classification synonyms). Categorization and classification allow humans to organize things, objects, and ideas that exist around them and simplify their understanding of the world. Categorization is something that humans and other organisms do: \"doing the right thing with the right kind of thing.\" The activity of categorizing things can be nonverbal or verbal. For humans, both concrete objects and abstract ideas are recognized, differentiated, and understood through categorization. Objects are usually categorized for some adaptive or pragmatic purposes.\nCategorization is grounded in the features that distinguish the category's members from nonmembers. Categorization is important in learning, prediction, inference, decision making, language, and many forms of organisms' interaction with their environments.\n\n", "Kept is a reality television series that centered on Jerry Hall (model and ex-wife to Mick Jagger) searching for a kept man.

Today, they live in Oklahoma and Florida, and comprise three federally recognized tribes: the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma, the Seminole Tribe of Florida, and the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, as well as independent groups. The Seminole people emerged in a process of ethnogenesis from various Native American groups who settled in Spanish Florida beginning in the early 1700s, most significantly northern Muscogee Creeks from what is now Georgia and Alabama.The word \"Seminole\" is derived from the Muscogee word siman\u00f3-li.

It operates on analog signals whose amplitude varies continuously. In the case of a periodic signal, the time difference can be described in terms of a change in the phase of the signal. One example of an analog delay line is a bucket-brigade device.Other types of delay line include acoustic (usually ultrasonic), magnetostrictive, and surface acoustic wave devices. A series of resistor\u2013capacitor circuits (RC circuits) can be cascaded to form a delay. A long transmission line can also provide a delay element. The delay time of an analog delay line may be only a few nanoseconds or several milliseconds, limited by the practical size of the physical medium used to delay the signal and the propagation speed of impulses in the medium.Analog delay lines are applied in many types of signal processing circuits; for example the PAL television standard uses an analog delay.", "West or Occident is one of the four cardinal directions or points of the compass.

At the most fundamental level information pertains to the interpretation of that which may be sensed.  Any natural process that is not completely random, and any observable pattern in any medium can be said to convey some amount of information.  Whereas digital signals and other data use discrete signs to convey information, other phenomena and artifacts such as analog signals, poems, pictures, music or other sounds, and currents convey information in a more continuous form.  Information is not knowledge itself, but the meaning that may be derived from a representation through interpretation.Information is often processed iteratively: Data available at one step are processed into information to be interpreted and processed at the next step.  For example, in written text each symbol or letter conveys information relevant to the word it is part of, each word conveys information relevant to the phrase it is part of, each phrase conveys information relevant to the sentence it is part of, and so on until at the final step information is interpreted and becomes knowledge in a given domain.  In a digital signal, bits may be interpreted into the symbols, letters, numbers, or structures that convey the information available at the next level up.  The key characteristic of information is that it is subject to interpretation and processing.The concept of information is relevant in various contexts, including those of constraint, communication, control, data, form, education, knowledge, meaning, understanding, mental stimuli, pattern, perception, proposition, representation, and entropy.The derivation of information from a signal or message may be thought of as the resolution of ambiguity or uncertainty that arises during the interpretation of patterns within the signal or message.Information may be structured as data. Redundant data can be compressed up to an optimal size, which is the theoretical limit of compression.The information available through a collection of data may be derived by analysis.  For example, data may be collected from a single customer's order at a restaurant.  The information available from many orders may be analyzed, and then becomes knowledge that is put to use when the business subsequently is able to identify the most popular or least popular dish.Information can be transmitted in time, via data storage, and space, via communication and telecommunication. Information is expressed either as the content of a message or through direct or indirect observation. That which is perceived can be construed as a message in its own right, and in that sense, all information is always conveyed as the content of a message.Information can be encoded into various forms for transmission and interpretation (for example, information may be encoded into a sequence of signs, or transmitted via a signal). It can also be encrypted for safe storage and communication.The uncertainty of an event is measured by its probability of occurrence. Uncertainty is inversely proportional.", "A choice is the range of different things from which a being can choose.  The arrival at a choice may incorporate motivators and models.  For example, a traveler might choose a route for a journey based on the preference of arriving at a given destination at a specified time.

Physics is one of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, with its main goal being to understand how the universe behaves. A scientist who specializes in the field of physics is called a physicist.\nPhysics is one of the oldest academic disciplines and, through its inclusion of astronomy, perhaps the oldest. Over much of the past two millennia, physics, chemistry, biology, and certain branches of mathematics were a part of natural philosophy, but during the Scientific Revolution in the 17th century these natural sciences emerged as unique research endeavors in their own right. Physics intersects with many interdisciplinary areas of research, such as biophysics and quantum chemistry, and the boundaries of physics are not rigidly defined. New ideas in physics often explain the fundamental mechanisms studied by other sciences and suggest new avenues of research in these and other academic disciplines such as mathematics and philosophy.\nAdvances in physics often enable advances in new technologies. For example, advances in the understanding of electromagnetism, solid-state physics, and nuclear physics led directly to the development of new products that have dramatically transformed modern-day society, such as television, computers, domestic appliances, and nuclear weapons; advances in thermodynamics led to the development of industrialization; and advances in mechanics inspired the development of calculus.", "Chemistry is the scientific study of the properties and behavior of matter. It is a physical science under natural sciences that covers the elements that make up matter to the compounds made of atoms, molecules and ions: their composition, structure, properties, behavior and the changes they undergo during a reaction with other substances. Chemistry also addresses the nature of chemical bonds in chemical compounds.\nIn the scope of its subject, chemistry occupies an intermediate position between physics and biology. It is sometimes called the central science because it provides a foundation for understanding both basic and applied scientific disciplines at a fundamental level. For example, chemistry explains aspects of plant growth (botany), the formation of igneous rocks (geology), how atmospheric ozone is formed and how environmental pollutants are degraded (ecology), the properties of the soil on the moon (cosmochemistry), how medications work (pharmacology), and how to collect DNA evidence at a crime scene (forensics).", "English usually refers to:\n\nEnglish language\nEnglish peopleEnglish may also refer to:\n\n", "A college (Latin: collegium) is an educational institution or a constituent part of one.

Any quantity that can vary over space or time can be used as a signal to share messages between observers. The IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing includes audio, video, speech, image, sonar, and radar as examples of signal. A signal may also be defined as any observable change in a quantity over space or time (a time series), even if it does not carry information.In nature, signals can be actions done by an organism to alert other organisms, ranging from the release of plant chemicals to warn nearby plants of a predator, to sounds or motions made by animals to alert other animals of food. Signaling occurs in all organisms even at cellular levels, with cell signaling. Signaling theory, in evolutionary biology, proposes that a substantial driver for evolution is the ability of animals to communicate with each other by developing ways of signaling. In human engineering, signals are typically provided by a sensor, and often the original form of a signal is converted to another form of energy using a transducer. For example, a microphone converts an acoustic signal to a voltage waveform, and a speaker does the reverse.Another important property of a signal is its entropy or information content. Information theory serves as the formal study of signals and their content. The information of a signal is often accompanied by noise, which primarily refers to unwanted modifications of signals, but is often extended to include unwanted signals conflicting with desired signals (crosstalk).

People may be discriminated on the basis of race, gender, age, religion, disability, or sexual orientation, as well as other categories. Discrimination especially occurs when individuals or groups are unfairly treated in a way which is worse than other people are treated, on the basis of their actual or perceived membership in certain groups or social categories. It involves restricting members of one group from opportunities or privileges that are available to members of another group.Discriminatory traditions, policies, ideas, practices and laws exist in many countries and institutions in all parts of the world, including territories where discrimination is generally looked down upon.

Usually based on a contract, one party, the employer, which might be a corporation, a not-for-profit organization, a co-operative, or any other entity, pays the other, the employee, in return for carrying out assigned work. Employees work in return for wages, which can be paid on the basis of an hourly rate, by piecework or an annual salary, depending on the type of work an employee does, the prevailing conditions of the sector and the bargaining power between the parties. Employees in some sectors may receive gratuities, bonus payments or stock options. In some types of employment, employees may receive benefits in addition to payment. Benefits may include health insurance, housing, disability insurance.

The word \"chef\" is derived from the term chef de cuisine (French pronunciation: \u200b[\u0283\u025bf d\u0259 k\u0265izin]), the director or head of a kitchen. Chefs can receive formal training from an institution, as well as by apprenticing with an experienced chef.\nThere are different terms that use the word chef in their titles, and deal with specific areas of food preparation. Examples include the sous-chef, who acts as the second-in-command in a kitchen, and the chef de partie, who handles a specific area of production. The kitchen brigade system is a hierarchy found in restaurants and hotels employing extensive staff, many of which use the word \"chef\" in their titles. Underneath the chefs are the kitchen assistants. A chef's standard uniform includes a hat (called a toque), neckerchief, double-breasted jacket, apron and sturdy shoes (that may include steel or plastic toe-caps).", "York is a cathedral city in North Yorkshire, England, with Roman origins, sited at the confluence of the rivers Ouse and Foss. It is the historic county town of Yorkshire. The city has many historic buildings and other structures, such as a minster, castle, and city walls. It is the largest settlement and the administrative centre of the wider City of York district.The city was founded under the name of Eboracum in 71 AD. It then became the capital of the Roman province of Britannia Inferior, and later of the kingdoms of Deira, Northumbria, and Scandinavian York. In the Middle Ages, it became the northern England ecclesiastical province's centre, and grew as a wool-trading centre. In the 19th century, it became a major railway network hub and confectionery manufacturing centre. During the Second World War, part of the Baedeker Blitz bombed the city; it was less affected by the war than other northern cities, with several historic buildings being gutted and restored up to the 1960s.The city is one of 15 in England to have a lord mayor, and one of three to have The Right Honourable title affixed, the others being London's and Bristol's. Historic governance of the city was as a county corporate, not included in the county's riding system. The city has since.", "All-electric range (AER) is the maximum driving range of an electric vehicle using only power from its on-board battery pack to traverse a given driving cycle. In the case of an all-electric vehicle, it means the maximum range per recharge. For a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV), it means the maximum range in charge-depleting mode, as PHEVs can travel considerably further in charge-sustaining mode which utilizes both fuel combustion and the on-board battery pack.Calculating AER is made more complicated in PHEVs because of variations in drivetrain design.  A vehicle like the Fisker Karma that uses a serial hybrid design has a clear AER.  Similarly a vehicle like the Chevrolet Volt which disengages the internal combustion engine (ICE) from the drivetrain while in electric mode has a clear AER, however blend-mode PHEVs which use the ICE and electric motor in conjunction do not have a clear AER because they use both gasoline and electricity at the same time. Equivalent AER is the AER of vehicles following this architecture.  One example of this calculation can be found in Argonne National Labs report titled \"TEST PROCEDURES AND BENCHMARKING Blended-Type and EV-Capable Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles.\"This procedure uses the formula.", "A battery charger, recharger, or simply charger, is a device that stores energy in a battery by running an electric current through it. The charging protocol (how much voltage or current for how long, and what to do when charging is complete) depends on the size and type of the battery being charged. Some battery types have high tolerance for overcharging (i.e., continued charging after the battery has been fully charged) and can be recharged by connection to a constant voltage source or a constant current source, depending on battery type. Simple chargers of this type must be manually disconnected at the end of the charge cycle. Other battery types use a timer to cut off when charging should be complete. Other battery types cannot withstand over-charging, becoming damaged (reduced capacity, reduced lifetime), over heating or even exploding. The charger may have temperature or voltage sensing circuits and a microprocessor controller to safely adjust the charging current and voltage, determine the state of charge, and cut off at the end of charge. Chargers may elevate the output voltage proportionally with current to compensate for impedance in the wires.A trickle charger provides a relatively small amount of current, only enough to counteract self-discharge of a battery that is idle for a long time. Some battery types cannot tolerate trickle charging;  attempts to do so may result in damage.  Lithium-ion batteries cannot handle  indefinite trickle charging. Slow battery chargers may take several hours to complete a charge. High-rate chargers may restore most capacity much faster, but high rate chargers can be more than some battery types can tolerate. Such batteries require active monitoring of the battery to protect it from overcharging. Electric vehicles ideally need high-rate chargers. For public access, installation of such chargers and the distribution support for them is an issue in the proposed adoption of electric cars.", "Causes, or causality, is the relationship between one event and another.

The purpose of the family is to maintain the well-being of its members and of society. Ideally, families offer predictability, structure, and safety as members mature and learn to participate in the community. Historically, most human societies use family as the primary locus of attachment, nurturance, and socialization.Anthropologists classify most family organizations as matrifocal (a mother and her children), patrifocal (a father and his children), conjugal (a wife, her husband, and children, also called the nuclear family), avuncular (a man, his sister, and her children), or extended (in addition to parents and children, may include grandparents, aunts, uncles, or cousins).\nThe field of genealogy aims to trace family lineages through history.

It is often quantified numerically using SI derived units (such as the cubic metre and litre) or by various imperial or US customary units (such as the gallon, quart, cubic inch). The definition of length (cubed) is interrelated with volume. The volume of a container is generally understood to be the capacity of the container; i.e., the amount of fluid (gas or liquid) that the container could hold, rather than the amount of space the container itself displaces.\nIn ancient times, volume is measured using similar-shaped natural containers and later on, standardized containers. Some simple three-dimensional shapes can have their volume easily calculated using arithmetic formulas. Volumes of more complicated shapes can be calculated with integral calculus if a formula exists for the shape's boundary. Zero-, one- and two-dimensional objects have no volume; in fourth and higher dimensions, an analogous concept to the normal volume is the hypervolume.", "A community is a social unit (a group of living things) with commonality such as place, norms, religion, values, customs, or identity.  Communities may share a sense of place situated in a given geographical area (e.g. a country, village, town, or neighbourhood) or in virtual space through communication platforms. Durable good relations that extend beyond immediate genealogical ties also define a sense of community, important to their identity, practice, and roles in social institutions such as family, home, work, government, society, or humanity at large. Although communities are usually small relative to personal social ties, \"community\" may also refer to large group affiliations such as national communities, international communities, and virtual communities.The English-language word \"community\" derives from the Old French comunet\u00e9 (Modern French: communaut\u00e9), which comes from the Latin communitas \"community\", \"public spirit\" (from Latin communis, \"common\").Human communities may have intent, belief, resources, preferences, needs, and risks in common, affecting the identity of the participants and their degree of cohesiveness.", "Color (American English) or colour (Commonwealth English) is the visual perception based on the electromagnetic spectrum. Though color is not an inherent property of matter, color perception is related to an object's light absorption, reflection, emission spectra and interference. For most humans, color are perceived in the visible light spectrum with three types of cone cells (trichromacy). Other animals may have a different number of cone cell types or have eyes sensitive to different wavelength, such as bees that can distinguish ultraviolet, and thus has a different color sensitivity range. Animal perception of color originates from different light wavelength or spectral sensitivity in cone cell types, which is then processed by the brain.Colors have perceived properties such as hue, colorfulness (saturation) and luminance. Colors can also be additively mixed (commonly used for actual light) or subtractively mixed (commonly used for materials). If the colors are mixed in the right proportions, because of metamerism, they may look the same as a single-wavelength light. For convenience, colors can be organized in a color space, which when being abstracted as a mathematical color model can assign each region of color with a corresponding set of numbers. As such, color spaces are an essential tool for color reproduction in print, photography, computer monitors and television. The most well-known color models are RGB, CMYK, YUV, HSL and HSV.Because the perception of color is an important aspect of human life, different colors have been associated with emotions, activity, and nationality. Names of color regions in different cultures can have different, sometimes overlapping areas.

Batters have to adapt to various conditions when playing on different cricket pitches, especially in different countries; therefore, as well as having outstanding physical batting skills, top-level batters will have quick reflexes, excellent decision-making skills, and be good strategists.During an innings two members of the batting side are on the pitch at any time: the one facing the current delivery from the bowler is called the striker, while the other is the non-striker. When a batter is out, he is replaced by a teammate. This continues until the end of the innings, which in most cases is when 10 of the team members are out, whereupon the other team gets a turn to bat.Batting tactics and strategy vary depending on the type of match being played as well as the current state of play. The main concerns for the batters are not to lose their wicket and to score as many runs as quickly as possible. These objectives generally conflict\u2014to score quickly, risky shots must be played, increasing the chance that the batter will be dismissed, while the batter's safest choice with a careful wicket-guarding stroke may be not to attempt any runs at all.

William James (1890) wrote that \"Attention is the taking possession by the mind, in clear and vivid form, of one out of what seem several simultaneously possible objects or trains of thought. Focalization, concentration, of consciousness are of its essence.\" Attention has also been described as the allocation of limited cognitive processing resources. Attention is manifested by an attentional bottleneck, in terms of the amount of data the brain can process each second; for example, in human vision, only less than 1% of the visual input data (at around one megabyte per second) can enter the bottleneck, leading to inattentional blindness.Attention remains a crucial area of investigation within education, psychology, neuroscience, cognitive neuroscience, and neuropsychology. Areas of active investigation involve determining the source of the sensory cues and signals that generate attention, the effects of these sensory cues and signals on the tuning properties of sensory neurons, and the relationship between attention and other behavioral and cognitive processes, which may include working memory and psychological vigilance. A relatively new body of research, which expands upon earlier research within psychopathology, is investigating the diagnostic symptoms associated with traumatic brain injury.", "Berlin ( bur-LIN, German: [b\u025b\u0250\u032f\u02c8li\u02d0n] (listen)) is the capital and largest city of Germany by both area and population. Its 3.7 million inhabitants make it the European Union's most populous city, according to population within city limits. One of Germany's sixteen constituent states, Berlin is surrounded by the State of Brandenburg and contiguous with Potsdam, Brandenburg's capital. Berlin's urban area, which has a population of around 4.5 million, is the second most populous urban area in Germany after the Ruhr. The Berlin-Brandenburg capital region has around 6.2 million inhabitants and is Germany's third-largest metropolitan region after the Rhine-Ruhr and Rhine-Main regions.Berlin straddles the banks of the Spree, which flows into the Havel (a tributary of the Elbe) in the western borough of Spandau. Among the city's main topographical features are the many lakes in the western and southeastern boroughs formed by the Spree, Havel and Dahme, the largest of which is Lake M\u00fcggelsee. Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. About one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers, canals, and lakes. The city lies in the Central German dialect area, the Berlin dialect being a variant of the Lusatian-New Marchian dialects.\nFirst documented in the 13th century and at the crossing of two important historic trade routes, Berlin became the capital of the Margraviate of Brandenburg (1417\u20131701), Kingdom of Prussia (1701\u20131918), German Empire (1871\u20131918), Weimar Republic (1919\u20131933), and Nazi Germany (1933\u20131945). Berlin has served as a scientific, artistic and philosophical hub of the Enlightenment, Neoclassicism, and liberal revolution. The Gr\u00fcnderzeitcode: deu promoted to code: de  era's \nindustrialization-induced economic boom multiplied Berlin's population rapidly. Berlin in the roaring 1920s was the third-largest city in the world by population.After World War II and its subsequent occupation by the victorious countries, the devastated city was divided; West Berlin became a de facto exclave of West Germany, surrounded by the Berlin Wall (from August 1961 to November 1989) and East German territory. East Berlin was declared capital of East Germany, while Bonn became the West German capital. Following German reunification in 1990, Berlin once again became the capital of all of Germany.\nBerlin is a world city of culture, politics, media and science. Its economy is based on high-tech firms and the service sector, encompassing a diverse range of creative industries, startup companies, research facilities, media corporations, and convention venues. Berlin serves as a continental hub for air and rail traffic and has a highly complex public transportation network. The metropolis is a popular tourist destination. Significant industries also include information technology, healthcare, biomedical engineering, biotechnology, automotive, construction, electronics, social economy and clean tech.\nBerlin is home to world-renowned universities such as the Humboldt University, Technical University, Free University, University of the Arts, ESMT Berlin, Hertie School, and Bard College Berlin. Its Zoological Garden is the most visited zoo in Europe and one of the most popular worldwide. With Babelsberg being the world's first large-scale movie studio complex, Berlin is an increasingly popular location for international film productions. The city is well known for its festivals, diverse architecture, nightlife, contemporary arts, and a very high quality of life.Berlin is also home to three World Heritage Sites: Museum Island; the Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin; and the Modernism Housing Estates. Other landmarks include the Brandenburg Gate, Reichstag building, Potsdamer Platz, Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe, Berlin Wall Memorial, East Side Gallery, Berlin Victory Column, Berlin Cathedral, and Berlin Television Tower, the tallest structure in Germany.

The term can refer to a television set, or the medium of television transmission. Television is a mass medium for advertising, entertainment, news, and sports.Television became available in crude experimental forms in the late 1920s, but only after several years of further development was the new technology marketed to consumers. After World War II, an improved form of black-and-white television broadcasting became popular in the United Kingdom and the United States, and television sets became commonplace in homes, businesses, and institutions. During the 1950s, television was the primary medium for influencing public opinion. In the mid-1960s, color broadcasting was introduced in the U.S. and most other developed countries.The availability of various types of archival storage media such as Betamax and VHS tapes, LaserDiscs, high-capacity hard disk drives, CDs, DVDs, flash drives, high-definition HD DVDs and Blu-ray Discs, and cloud digital video recorders has enabled viewers to watch pre-recorded material\u2014such as movies\u2014at home on their own time schedule. For many reasons, especially the convenience of remote retrieval, the storage of television and video programming now also occurs on the cloud (such as the video-on-demand service by Netflix). At the end of the first decade of the 2000s, digital television transmissions greatly increased in popularity. Another development was the move from standard-definition television (SDTV) (576i, with 576 interlaced lines of resolution and 480i) to high-definition television (HDTV), which provides a resolution that is substantially higher. HDTV may be transmitted in different formats: 1080p, 1080i and 720p. Since 2010, with the invention of smart television, Internet television has increased the availability of television programs and movies via the Internet through streaming video services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, iPlayer and Hulu.In 2013, 79% of the world's households owned a television set..", "Radio is the technology of signaling and communicating using radio waves. Radio waves are electromagnetic waves of frequency between 30 hertz (Hz) and 300 gigahertz (GHz). They are generated by an electronic device called a transmitter connected to an antenna which radiates the waves, and received by another antenna connected to a radio receiver. Radio is widely used in modern technology, in radio communication, radar, radio navigation, remote control, remote sensing, and other applications.In radio communication, used in radio and television broadcasting, cell phones, two-way radios, wireless networking, and satellite communication, among numerous other uses, radio waves are used to carry information across space from a transmitter to a receiver, by modulating the radio signal (impressing an information signal on the radio wave by varying some aspect of the wave) in the transmitter. In radar, used to locate and track objects like aircraft, ships, spacecraft and missiles, a beam of radio waves emitted by a radar transmitter reflects off the target object, and the reflected waves reveal the object's location. In radio navigation systems such as GPS and VOR, a mobile receiver accepts radio signals from navigational radio beacons whose position is known, and by precisely measuring the arrival time of the radio waves the receiver can calculate its position on Earth. In wireless radio remote control devices like drones, garage door openers, and keyless entry systems, radio signals transmitted from a controller device control the actions of a remote device.Applications of radio waves that do not involve transmitting the waves significant distances, such as RF heating used in industrial processes and microwave ovens, and medical uses such as diathermy and MRI machines, are not usually called radio.  The noun radio is also used to mean a broadcast radio receiver.The existence of radio waves was first proven.", "Summer is the hottest of the four temperate seasons, occurring after spring and before autumn. At or centred on the summer solstice, daylight hours are longest and darkness hours are shortest, with day length decreasing as the season progresses after the solstice. The earliest sunrises and latest sunsets also occur near the date of the solstice. The date of the beginning of summer varies according to climate, tradition, and culture.

It is the commercial and transportation hub of Cape Cod and was designated an urban area at the 1990 census. Because of this, many refer to Hyannis as the \"Capital of the Cape\". It contains a majority of the Barnstable Town offices and two important shopping districts: the historic downtown Main Street and the Route 132 Commercial District, including Cape Cod Mall and Independence Park, headquarters of Cape Cod Potato Chips. Cape Cod Hospital in Hyannis is the largest on Cape Cod.\nHyannis is a major tourist destination and the primary ferry boat and general aviation link for passengers and freight to Nantucket Island. Hyannis also provides secondary passenger access to the island of Martha's Vineyard, with the primary passenger access to Martha's Vineyard being located in Woods Hole, a village in the nearby town of Falmouth. Due to its large natural harbor, Hyannis is the largest recreational boating and second largest commercial fishing port on Cape Cod, behind only Provincetown.\nThe village is the namesake of the former United States Naval ship USS Hyannis (YTB-817).", "A port is a maritime facility comprising one or more wharves or loading areas, where ships load and discharge cargo and passengers. Although usually situated on a sea coast or estuary, ports can also be found far inland, such as Hamburg, Manchester and Duluth; these access the sea via rivers or canals. Because of their roles as ports of entry for immigrants as well as soldiers in wartime, many port cities have experienced dramatic multi-ethnic and multicultural changes throughout their histories.Ports are extremely important to the global economy; 70% of global merchandise trade by value passes through a port. For this reason, ports are also often densely populated settlements that provide the labor for processing and handling goods and related services for the ports.  Today by far the greatest growth in port development is in Asia, the continent with some of the world's largest and busiest ports, such as Singapore and the Chinese ports of Shanghai and Ningbo-Zhoushan. As of 2020, the busiest passenger port in Europe is the Port of Helsinki in Finland. Nevertheless, countless smaller ports do exist that may only serve their local tourism or fishing industries.\nPorts can have a wide environmental impact on local ecologies and waterways, most importantly water quality, which can be caused by dredging, spills and other pollution. Ports are heavily affected by changing environmental factors caused by climate change as most port infrastructure is extremely vulnerable to sea level rise and coastal flooding. Internationally, global ports are beginning to identify ways to improve coastal management practices and integrate climate change adaptation practices into their construction.", "In computing, a code segment, also known as a text segment or simply as text, is a portion of an object file or the corresponding section of the program's virtual address space that contains executable instructions.", "Bless Yo Trap is a collaborative mixtape by American rapper Smokepurpp and Canadian record producer Murda Beatz.

Interscope's VP, Tom Whalley, told Billboard magazine that \"the high quality of songwriting in Dish and the sound of Dana's voice are two things that set this band apart.\"The album was not a commercial success and the group's members moved on to other projects, however the album did garner favorable reviews. CMJ New Music reviewed the album saying Kletter's vocals sounded like \"tomboy version\" of Natalie Merchant, while Trouser Press described the album as offering \"elegant, haunting melodies with nary a hint of excess sugar\". Musician noted \"lush melodies and oblique lyrics\".

Common-law legal systems place great value on deciding cases according to consistent principled rules, so that similar facts will yield similar and predictable outcomes, and observance of precedent is the mechanism by which that goal is attained. The principle by which judges are bound to precedents is known as stare decisis (a Latin phrase with the literal meaning of \"to stand in the-things-that-have-been-decided\"). Common-law precedent is a third kind of law, on equal footing with statutory law (that is, statutes and codes enacted by legislative bodies) and subordinate legislation (that is, regulations promulgated by executive branch agencies, in the form of delegated legislation) in UK parlance \u2013 or regulatory law (in US parlance).\nCase law, in common-law jurisdictions, is the set of decisions of adjudicatory tribunals or other rulings that can be cited as precedent. In most countries, including most European countries, the term is applied to any set of rulings on law, which is guided by previous rulings, for example, previous decisions of a government agency. Essential to the development of case law is the publication and indexing of decisions for use by lawyers, courts, and the general public, in the form of law reports. A precedent is a historical setting example for the future (though at varying levels of authority as discussed throughout this article), some become \"leading cases\" or \"landmark decisions\" that are cited especially often.\nGenerally speaking, a legal precedent is said to be:\n\napplied (if precedent is binding) / adopted (if precedent is persuasive), if the principles underpinning the previous decision are accordingly used to evaluate the issues of the subsequent case;\ndistinguished, if the principles underpinning the previous decision are found specific to, or premised upon, certain factual scenarios, and not applied to the subsequent case because of the absence or material difference in the latter's facts;\nmodified, if the same court on determination of the same case on order from a higher court modified one or more parts of the previous decision; or\noverruled, if the same or higher courts on appeal or determination of subsequent cases found the principles underpinning the previous decision erroneous in law or overtaken by new legislation or developments.In contrast, civil law systems adhere to a legal positivism, where past decisions do not usually have the precedential, binding effect that they have in common law decision-making; the judicial review practiced by constitutional courts can be regarded as a notable exception.", "Financial statements (or financial reports) are formal records of the financial activities and position of a business, person, or other entity.Relevant financial information is presented in a structured manner and in a form which is easy to understand.

Specialized hospitals include trauma centers, rehabilitation hospitals, children's hospitals, seniors' (geriatric) hospitals, and hospitals for dealing with specific medical needs such as psychiatric treatment (see psychiatric hospital) and certain disease categories. Specialized hospitals can help reduce health care costs compared to general hospitals.

A person may also semi-retire by reducing work hours or workload.Many people choose to retire when they are elderly or incapable of doing their job due to health reasons. People may also retire when they are eligible for private or public pension benefits, although some are forced to retire when bodily conditions no longer allow the person to work any longer (by illness or accident) or as a result of legislation concerning their positions. In most countries, the idea of retirement is of recent origin, being introduced during the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. Previously, low life expectancy, lack of social security and the absence of pension arrangements meant that most workers continued to work until their death. Germany was the first country to introduce retirement benefits in 1889.Nowadays, most developed countries have systems to provide pensions on retirement in old age, funded by employers or the state.

A variety of definitions have been used for different purposes over time. Health can be promoted by encouraging healthful activities, such as regular physical exercise and adequate sleep, and by reducing or avoiding unhealthful activities or situations, such as smoking or excessive stress. Some factors affecting health are due to individual choices, such as whether to engage in a high-risk behavior, while others are due to structural causes, such as whether the society is arranged in a way that makes it easier or harder for people to get necessary healthcare services.

In business, the cost may be one of acquisition, in which case the amount of money expended to acquire it is counted as cost. In this case, money is the input that is gone in order to acquire the thing. This acquisition cost may be the sum of the cost of production as incurred by the original producer, and further costs of transaction as incurred by the acquirer over and above the price paid to the producer. Usually, the price also includes a mark-up for profit over the cost of production.\nMore generalized in the field of economics, cost is a metric that is totaling up as a result of a process or as a differential for the result of a decision.

The party making the payment is commonly called the payer, while the payee is the party receiving the payment.\nPayments can be effected in a number of ways, for example:\n\nthe use of money, cheque, or debit, credit, or bank transfers, whether through mobile payment or otherwise\nthe transfer of anything of value, such as stock, or using barter, or personal data, the exchange of one good or service for another.In general, payees are at liberty to determine what method of payment they will accept; though normally laws require the payer to accept the country's legal tender up to a prescribed limit. Payment is most commonly effected in the local currency of the payee unless the parties agree otherwise. Payment in another currency involves an additional foreign exchange transaction. The payee may compromise on a debt, i.e., accept part payment in full settlement of a debtor's obligation, or may offer a discount, E.G: For payment in cash, or for prompt payment, etc. On the other hand, the payee may impose a surcharge, for example, as a late payment fee, or for use of a certain credit card, etc.\nPayments are frequently preceded by an invoice or bill, which follows the supply of goods or services, but in some industries (such as travel and hotels) it is not uncommon for pre-payments to be required before the service is performed or provided. In some industries, a deposit may be required before services are performed, which acts as a part pre-payment or as security to the service provider. In some cases, progress payments are made in advance, and in some cases part payments are accepted, which do not extinguish the payer\u2019s legal obligations. The acceptance of a payment by the payee extinguishes a debt or other obligation. A creditor cannot unreasonably refuse to accept a payment, but payment can be refused in some circumstances, for example, on a Sunday or outside banking hours. A payee is usually obligated to acknowledge payment by producing a receipt to the payer. A receipt may be an endorsement on an account as \"paid in full\". The giving of a guarantee or other security for a debt does not constitute a payment.\n\n", "A patient is any recipient of health care services that are performed by healthcare professionals.

Communities may share a sense of place situated in a given geographical area (e.g. a country, village, town, or neighbourhood) or in virtual space through communication platforms. Durable good relations that extend beyond immediate genealogical ties also define a sense of community, important to their identity, practice, and roles in social institutions such as family, home, work, government, society, or humanity at large. Although communities are usually small relative to personal social ties, \"community\" may also refer to large group affiliations such as national communities, international communities, and virtual communities.The English-language word \"community\" derives from the Old French comunet\u00e9 (Modern French: communaut\u00e9), which comes from the Latin communitas \"community\", \"public spirit\" (from Latin communis, \"common\").Human communities may have intent, belief, resources, preferences, needs, and risks in common, affecting the identity of the participants and their degree of cohesiveness.\n\n", "Album of the Year is the third album by The Good Life.

An expense is a cost that is \"paid\" or \"remitted\", usually in exchange for something of value. Something that seems to cost a great deal is \"expensive\". Something that seems to cost little is \"inexpensive\". \"Expenses of the table\" are expenses for dining, refreshments, a feast, etc.\n\nIn accounting, expense is any specific outflow of cash or other valuable assets from a person or company to another person or company. This outflow is generally one side of a trade for products or services that have equal or better current or future value to the buyer than to the seller. Technically, an expense is an event in which a proprietary stake is diminished or exhausted, or a liability is incurred. In terms of the accounting equation, expenses reduce owners' equity. The International Accounting Standards Board defines expenses as:...decreases in economic benefits during the accounting period in the form of outflows or depletions of assets or incurrences of liabilities that result in decreases in equity, other than those relating to distributions to equity participants.\nExpense is a term also used in sociology, in which a particular fortune or price is sacrificed voluntarily or involuntarily by something or someone to something or somebody else, often in the context that the latter is taking advantage of the former.", "A Santa Cause: It's a Punk Rock Christmas was released November 11, 2003 on the label Immortal Records.

In general usage, the term deductible may be used to describe one of several types of clauses that are used by insurance companies as a threshold for policy payments.Deductibles are typically used to deter the large number of claims that a consumer can be reasonably expected to bear the cost of. By restricting its coverage to events that are significant enough to incur large costs, the insurance firm expects to pay out slightly smaller amounts much less frequently, incurring much higher savings. As a result, insurance premiums are typically cheaper when they involve higher deductibles.

One plan may have a premium of.", "Malingering is the fabrication, feigning, or exaggeration of physical or psychological symptoms designed to achieve a desired outcome, such as relief from duty or work.Malingering is not a medical diagnosis, but may be recorded as a \"focus of clinical attention\" or a \"reason for contact with health services\". Malingering is categorized as distinct from other forms of excessive illness behavior such as somatization disorder and factitious disorder, although not all mental health professionals agree with this formulation.Failure to detect actual cases of malingering imposes an economic burden on health care systems, workers' compensation programs, and disability programs, such as Social Security Disability Insurance and veterans' disability benefits.

Overcrowding in the home can cause particular concern, since the home is an individual's place of shelter.\nEffects on quality of life due to crowding may include increased physical contact, lack of sleep, lack of privacy and poor hygiene practices.\nWhile population density offers an objective measure of the number of people living per unit area, overcrowding refers to people's psychological response to density. However, definitions of crowding used in statistical reporting and for administrative purposes depend on density measures and do not usually incorporate people's perceptions of crowding.\nIt is important to avoid over crowding in today's times as they lead to health problems.\nSome individuals are also not comfortable in crowded areas.

Medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness. Contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences, biomedical research, genetics, and medical technology to diagnose, treat, and prevent injury and disease, typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery, but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy, external splints and traction, medical devices, biologics, and ionizing radiation, amongst others.Medicine has been practiced since prehistoric times, and for most of this time it was an art (an area of creativity and skill), frequently having connections to the religious and philosophical beliefs of local culture. For example, a medicine man would apply herbs and say prayers for healing, or an ancient philosopher and physician would apply bloodletting according to the theories of humorism. In recent centuries, since the advent of modern science, most medicine has become a combination of art and science (both basic and applied, under the.", "A credit card is a payment card issued to users (cardholders) to enable the cardholder to pay a merchant for goods and services based on the cardholder's accrued debt (i.e., promise to the card issuer to pay them for the amounts plus the other agreed charges). The card issuer (usually a bank or credit union) creates a revolving account and grants a line of credit to the cardholder, from which the cardholder can borrow money for payment to a merchant or as a cash advance. There are two credit card groups: consumer credit cards and business credit cards. Most cards are plastic, but some are metal cards (stainless steel, gold, palladium, titanium), and a few gemstone-encrusted metal cards.A regular credit card is different from a charge card, which requires the balance to be repaid in full each month or at the end of each statement cycle. In contrast, credit cards allow the consumers to build a continuing balance of debt, subject to interest being charged. A credit card differs from a charge card also in that a credit card typically involves a third-party entity that pays the seller and is reimbursed by the buyer, whereas a charge card simply defers payment by the buyer until a later date.\nA credit card also differs from a debit card, which can be used like currency by the owner of the card. Alternatives to credit cards include debit cards, mobile payments, digital wallets, cryptocurrencies, pay-by-hand, bank transfers, and buy now, pay later. As of June 2018, there were 7.753 billion credit cards in the world. In 2020, there were 1.09 billion credit cards in circulation in the U.S and 72.5% of adults (187.3 million) in the country had at least one credit card.", "Freedom is understood as either having the ability to act or change without constraint or to possess the power and resources to fulfill one's purposes unhindered. Freedom is often associated with liberty and autonomy in the sense of \"giving oneself one's own laws\", and with having rights and the civil liberties with which to exercise them without undue interference by the state. Frequently discussed kinds of political freedom include freedom of assembly, freedom of association, freedom of choice, and freedom of speech.\nIn one definition, something is \"free\" if it can change easily and is not constrained in its present state. (Physicists and chemists may use the word in this sense.) Philosophy and religion sometimes associate freedom with free will, without undue or unjust constraints on that will, such as enslavement. It is an idea closely tied with the concept of negative liberty.\n Charles Taylor resolves one of the issues that separate \"positive\" and \"negative\" theories of freedom, as these were initially distinguished in Isaiah Berlin's seminal 1958 lecture,  \"Two concepts of liberty\". Taylor sees it as undeniable that there are two such families of conceptions of political freedom. Negative liberty is a concept that is often used in political philosophy. It is the idea that freedom means an ability to do what one wants, without external obstacles. This concept has been called too simplistic for discounting the importance of individual self-realization. Positive liberty is the ability to fulfill one's purposes.In its origin, the  English word \"freedom\" relates etymologically to the word \"friend\".", "A student is a person enrolled in a school or other educational institution.In the United Kingdom and most commonwealth countries, a \"student\" attends a secondary school or higher (e.g., college or university); those in primary or elementary schools are \"pupils\".", "Dentistry, also known as dental medicine and oral medicine, is the branch of medicine focused on the teeth, gums, and mouth. It consists of the study, diagnosis, prevention, management, and treatment of diseases, disorders, and conditions of the mouth, most commonly focused on dentition (the development and arrangement of teeth) as well as the oral mucosa. Dentistry may also encompass other aspects of the craniofacial complex including the temporomandibular joint. The practitioner is called a dentist.The history of dentistry is almost as ancient as the history of humanity and civilization, with the earliest evidence dating from 7000 BC to 5500 BC. Dentistry is thought to have been the first specialization in medicine which has gone on to develop its own accredited degree with its own specializations. Dentistry is often also understood to subsume the now largely defunct medical specialty of stomatology (the study of the mouth and its disorders and diseases) for which reason the two terms are used interchangeably in certain regions. However, some specialties such as oral and maxillofacial surgery (facial reconstruction) may require both medical and dental degrees to accomplish. In European history, dentistry is considered to have stemmed from the trade of barber surgeons.Dental treatments are carried out by a dental team, which often consists of a dentist and dental auxiliaries (dental assistants, dental hygienists, dental technicians, as well as dental therapists). Most dentists either work in private practices (primary care), dental hospitals or (secondary care) institutions (prisons, armed forces bases, etc.).The modern movement of evidence-based dentistry calls for the use of high-quality scientific research and evidence to guide decision-making such as in manual tooth conservation, use of fluoride water treatment and fluoride toothpaste, dealing with oral diseases such as tooth decay and periodontitis, as well as systematic diseases such as osteoporosis, diabetes, celiac disease, cancer, HIV/AIDS which could also affect the oral cavity. Other practices relevant to evidence-based dentistry include radiology of the mouth to inspect teeth deformity or oral malaises, haematology (study of blood) to avoid bleeding complications during dental surgery, cardiology (due to various severe complications arising from dental surgery.", "A scholarship is a form of financial aid awarded to students for further education. Generally, scholarships are awarded based on a set of criteria such as academic merit, diversity and inclusion, athletic skill, and financial need. \nScholarship criteria usually reflect the values and goals of the donor of the award, and while scholarship recipients are not required to repay scholarships, the awards may require that the recipient continue to meet certain requirements during their period of support, such maintaining a minimum grade point average or engaging in a certain activity (e.g., playing on a school sports team for athletic scholarship holders).Scholarships also range in generosity; some range from covering partial tuition ranging all the way to a 'full-ride', covering all tuition, accommodation, housing and others.\nSome prestigious, highly competitive scholarships are well-known even outside the academic community, such as Fulbright Scholarship and the Rhodes Scholarships at the graduate level, and the Robertson, Morehead-Cain and Jefferson Scholarships at the undergraduate level.", "A government is the system or group of people governing an organized community, generally a state.\nIn the case of its broad associative definition, government normally consists of legislature, executive, and judiciary. Government is a means by which organizational policies are enforced, as well as a mechanism for determining policy.

Historically prevalent forms of government include monarchy, aristocracy, timocracy, oligarchy, democracy, theocracy, and tyranny.

Area can be understood as the amount of material with a given thickness that would be necessary to fashion a model of the shape, or the amount of paint necessary to cover the surface with a single coat. It is the two-dimensional analogue of the length of a curve (a one-dimensional concept) or the volume of a solid (a three-dimensional concept).The area of a shape can be measured by comparing the shape to squares of a fixed size. In the International System of Units (SI), the standard unit of area is the square metre (written as m2), which is the area of a square whose sides are one metre long.

That means that all airports are aerodromes, but not all aerodromes are airports.

They are often research organisations (research institutes) created to do research on specific topics, or can also be a professional body. \nIn some countries, institutes can be part of a university or other institutions of higher education, either as a group of departments or an autonomous educational institution without a traditional university status such as a \"university institute\" (see Institute of Technology). In some countries, such as South Korea and India, private schools are sometimes referred to as institutes, and in Spain, secondary schools are referred to as institutes.\nHistorically, in some countries institutes were educational units imparting vocational training and often incorporating libraries, also known as mechanics' institutes. \nThe word \"institute\" comes from a Latin word institutum meaning \"facility\" or \"habit\"; from instituere meaning \"build\", \"create\", \"raise\" or \"educate\".", "In criminal justice, particularly in North America, correction, corrections, and correctional, are umbrella terms describing a variety of functions typically carried out by government agencies, and involving the punishment, treatment, and supervision of persons who have been convicted of crimes.

It is often understood as awareness of facts or as practical skills, and may also mean familiarity with objects or situations. Knowledge of facts, also called propositional knowledge, is often defined as true belief that is distinct from opinion or guesswork by virtue of justification. While there is wide agreement among philosophers that propositional knowledge is a form of true belief, many controversies in philosophy focus on justification: whether it is needed at all, how to understand it, and whether something else besides it is needed. These controversies intensified due to a series of thought experiments by Edmund Gettier and have provoked various alternative definitions. Some of them deny that justification is necessary and suggest alternative criteria while others accept that justification is an essential aspect and formulate additional requirements.Knowledge can be produced in many different ways. The most important source of empirical knowledge is perception, which refers to the usage of the senses. Many theorists also include introspection as a source of knowledge, not of external physical objects, but of one's own mental states. Other sources often discussed include memory, rational intuition, inference, and testimony. According to foundationalism, some of these sources are basic in the sense that they can justify beliefs without depending on other mental states..", "Dirksen is a surname.

The character may be entirely fictional or based on a real-life person, in which case the distinction of a \"fictional\" versus \"real\" character may be made. Derived from the Ancient Greek word \u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1, the English word dates from the Restoration, although it became widely used after its appearance in Tom Jones by Henry Fielding in 1749. From this, the sense of \"a part played by an actor\" developed. (Before this development, the term dramatis personae, naturalized in English from Latin and meaning \"masks of the drama,\" encapsulated the notion of characters from the literal aspect of masks.) Character, particularly when enacted by an actor in the theatre or cinema, involves \"the illusion of being a human person\". In literature, characters guide readers through their stories, helping them to understand plots and ponder themes.

Some of these derive from a unit of force divided by a unit of area; the SI unit of pressure, the pascal (Pa), for example, is one newton per square metre (N/m2); similarly, the pound-force per square inch (psi, symbol lbf/in2) is the traditional unit of pressure in the imperial and U.S. customary systems. Pressure may also be expressed in terms of standard atmospheric pressure; the atmosphere (atm) is equal to this pressure, and the torr is defined as 1\u2044760 of this. Manometric units such as the centimetre of water, millimetre of mercury, and inch of mercury are used to express pressures in terms of the height of column of a particular fluid in a manometer.\n\n", "14 Shades of Grey is the fourth studio album by American rock band Staind, released on May 20, 2003.

Housing ensures that members of society have a place to live, whether it is a home or some other kind of dwelling, lodging or shelter. Many governments have one or more housing authorities, sometimes also called a housing ministry or housing department.\nHousing in many different areas consists of public, social and private housing. In the United States, it was not until the 19th and 20th century that there was a lot more government involvement in housing. It was mainly aimed at helping those who were poor in the community. Public housing provides help and assistance to those who are poor and mainly low-income earners. A study report shows that there are many individuals living in public housing. There are over 1.2 million families or households. These types of housing were built mainly to provide people, mainly those who are low-income and elderly, with safe, affordable, and good housing units. There are many people who are a part of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). When counting, there are over nine hundred thousand participants in this program."]}
